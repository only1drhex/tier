            <p class="blog"><strong>NEW PRODUCT DECISIONS AT ACME WITH AN OPTION TO BUY INFORMATION </strong></p> <p class="blog">Suppose now that Acme has just about finished the development process on the new product, so that fixed development costs are no longer an issue, and technological failure is no longer a possibility. The only question is whether Acme should market the product, given the uncertainty about the eventual sales volume. If the company decides to market the product, it will incur fixed marketing costs of $4 million. To keep the model simple, we now assume that there are only two possible market outcomes, good or bad. The sales volumes for these two possible outcomes are 600,000 units and 100,000 units, and Acme assesses that their probabilities are 0.4 and 0.6. However, before making the ultimate decision, Acme has the option to hire a well-respected marketing research firm for $150,000. If Acme decides to use this option, the result will be a prediction of good or bad. That is, the marketing research firm will predict that either “We think the market for this product will be good” or “We think the market for this product will be bad.” Acme has used this firm before, so it has a sense of the prediction accuracy, as indicated in Table 6.1. Each row in this table indicates the actual market outcome, and each column indicates the prediction. If the actual market is good, the prediction will be good with probability 0.8 and bad with probability 0.2. If the actual market is bad, the prediction will be bad with probability 0.7 and good with probability 0.3. What should Acme do to maximize its EMV?</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 148px;" width="525"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="3" width="241">Table 6.1 Prediction Accuracy of Marketing Research Firm</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Actual/Predicted</td> <td>Good</td> <td>Bad</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Good</td> <td>0.8</td> <td>0.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bad</td> <td>0.3</td> <td>0.7</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

Acme must first decide whether to hire the marketing research firm. If it decides not to, it can then immediately decide whether to market the product. On the other hand, if it decides to hire the firm, it must then wait for the firm’s prediction. After the prediction is received, Acme can then make the ultimate decision on whether to market the product. However, when making this ultimate decision, Acme should definitely take the firm’s prediction into account.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A “skeleton” for the appropriate decision tree, without any of the correct probabilities or monetary values, appears in Figure 6.15. For now, just focus on the structure of the tree, and how time flows from left to right. The tree is not symmetric. If Acme doesn’t hire the firm, this “No” decision branch is followed immediately by another decision node for whether to market the product. However, if Acme does hire the firm, this “Yes” decision branch is followed by a probability node for the firm’s prediction. Then after a good or a bad prediction, there is a decision node for whether to market the product.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now it is time to label the tree with probabilities and monetary values. The monetary values present no problems, as will be seen shortly. However, the probabilities require a digression so that we can discuss Bayes’ rule. The problem is that the given probabilities in Table 6.1 are not the probabilities required in the tree. After we discuss Bayes’ rule, we will return to Acme’s decision problem.</p>
