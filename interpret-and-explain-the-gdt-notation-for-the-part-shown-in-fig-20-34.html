<span class="fontstyle0">Various aspects of the drawing are circled and annotated with note numbers that correlate with the explanations given here.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note 1</span><span class="fontstyle2">. The front face is defined as a datum feature and is used as the primary datum for several of the geometric controls on the drawing. Since the front face, rather than the back face, is selected as a datum, it is likely that this surface will fit against a mating surface. Functionally, this fit is apparently more important than the back face. The flatness control is common for a surface that is a primary datum.The entire surface must fit within a tolerance zone defined by two parallel planes separated by a distance of 0.05.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note 2</span><span class="fontstyle2">. Consider the outer surface of the protruding cylinder, which is identified as a datum feature. Since it is a feature of size, the datum is the center axis. More precisely, the datum is the theoretically perfect center axis of the imperfect outer surface, as determined by the unrelated actual mating envelope. </span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle2">Note that if the bore through the center of the part had been chosen as the datum feature, the datum would also have been a center axis, but not precisely the same one. The fact that the outer surface is selected indicates it may have greater functional precedent over the bore. Perhaps the outer cylindrical surface will fit within the bore of a mating part. Even though the function of the part is not specified, the geometric requirements of the functional needs are clear, and the part should be manufactured and inspected accordingly.Every feature of size must be controlled in all four geometric attributes: size, location, orientation, and form. Consider each in turn for the outer surface of the protruding cylinder.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The cylinder’s size is directly specified. The diameter at any cross section must be within the stated range of 39.06 to 40.00.The center axis of a feature of size must be located, usually by basic dimensions. In this case, since this is a datum feature, its own center axis becomes part of the definition of the origin of the datum reference frame. The feature’s location is at the origin, so no further basic dimensions are needed to locate it.The orientation of this cylinder feature is controlled by the perpendicularity control. This control requires the center axis of the feature to lie within a cylindrical tolerance zone that has a diameter of 0.05. The tolerance zone is exactly perpendicular to datum plane A; the center axis of the feature is allowed to tip within the tolerance zone. No specific form controls are specified for this feature. The form of its surface is controlled by default through Rule #1 for features of size. Rule #1 requires that the surface of the cylinder must be within the cylindrical envelope of perfect form at the MMC diameter of 40.00.This feature of size is controlled in all aspects: size, location, orientation,and form.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note 3</span><span class="fontstyle2">. Now consider the center bore. This is a feature of size, so its size is directly specified and toleranced. Its form is controlled by Rule #1. It is located by implication (since no basic dimensions are given) at the origin of the datum reference frame. Its orientation and location is controlled by the position control. The position control defines a cylindrical tolerance zone that is first held perpendicular to datum plane A, then centered at the datum axis defined from datum feature B. Since there is no material modifier specified on the tolerance, the default condition of </span><span class="fontstyle0">regardless of feature size (RFS) </span><span class="fontstyle2">applies.Therefore, the tolerance zone diameter is a constant 0.3, regardless of what size the feature is actually produced.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note 4</span><span class="fontstyle2">. The four holes are defined collectively as a pattern. They are features of size, so their diameters are directly dimensioned and toleranced, and their surfaces must not exceed the envelope of perfect form at the MMC diameter of 10 (Rule #1). Their location is specified by the basic dimension of 60 for the bolt circle, as well as by the implication that they are spaced at 90 degrees around the bolt circle.Control of orientation and location is provided by the position control. Specifically, the position control requires the center axis of each hole to be <span class="fontstyle0">within a cylindrical tolerance zone. The datum callouts require this tolerance zone to be first held perpendicular to datum A, then centered at the true location as measured with respect to datum axis B. The </span>M <span class="fontstyle0">modifier that accompanies datum B allows a little more leeway on the overall shift of the hole pattern if datum feature B is produced at a diameter less than its MMC.The zero tolerance value in the position control does not mean that no tolerance is allowed, as it is accompanied by the </span>M <span class="fontstyle0">modifier. This is known as </span><span class="fontstyle3">zero tolerancing </span><span class="fontstyle0">at MMC. The meaning is that the tolerance zone diameter is zero if the hole is produced at its maximum material diameter of 10, but grows to a diameter of 0.1 as the hole’s diameter increases to its least material diameter of 10.1. Consequently, the axis of the hole would need to be perfectly located and oriented if the hole is produced at its MMC of 10, but can deviate from perfection if the hole is produced at a larger size.</span> </span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note 5</span><span class="fontstyle2">. This cylindrical feature is a feature of size, and could have been directly dimensioned and toleranced. Instead, it is specified with a basic dimension of 90 with no tolerance or geometric control in sight. This does not mean it has to be perfect. It means that it is controlled by the default profile tolerance that is stated at the bottom of the drawing. The ideal cylindrical surface is first sized at the basic diameter of 90, and located with respect to datums A and B. Then a tolerance zone is centered around this ideal surface with a total tolerance of 0.2. In this case, the tolerance zone is the space between two concentric cylinders with diameters of 89.8 and 90.2 (a radial difference of 0.2). This tolerance zone controls all four geometric attributes of size, location, orientation, and form.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note 6</span><span class="fontstyle2">. The basic dimension of 20 locates the ideal surface of the front face of the protruding cylinder. The surface profile control requires that the actual front face lie within a tolerance zone consisting of the space of 0.1 between two planes centered around the ideal surface, where each plane is parallel to datum A. This effectively establishes the location of the face (a distance of 19.95 to 20.05 from datum A), as well as the flatness of the face, and the parallelism of the face with respect to datum A.</span></p>
