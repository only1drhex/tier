            <p class="blog">The condenser of a large steam power plant is a heat exchanger in which steam is condensed to liquid water. Assume the condenser to be a shell-and-tube heat exchanger consisting of a single shell and 30,000 tubes, each executing two passes. The tubes are of thin wall construction with D = 25 mm, and steam condenses on their outer surface with an associated convection coefficient of <span class="tex-text">\(h_{o} = 11,000 W/m^{2} . K\)</span>. The heat transfer rate that must be effected by the exchanger is <span class="tex-text">\(q = 2 × 10^{9} W\)</span>, and this is accomplished by passing cooling water through the tubes at a rate of <span class="tex-text">\(3× 10^{4} kg/s\)</span> (the flow rate per tube is therefore 1 kg/s). The water enters at 20°C, while the steam condenses at 50°C. What is the tempera-ture of the cooling water emerging from the condenser? What is the required tube length L per pass?</p>

Known: Heat exchanger consisting of single shell and 30,000 tubes with two passes each.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Find:<br /> 1. Outlet temperature of the cooling water.<br /> 2. Tube length per pass to achieve required heat transfer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assumptions:<br /> 1. Negligible heat transfer between exchanger and surroundings and negligible kinetic and potential energy changes.<br /> 2. Tube internal flow and thermal conditions fully developed.<br /> 3. Negligible thermal resistance of tube material and fouling effects.<br /> 4. Constant properties.</p>

Properties: , water (assume <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{T}_{c} ≈ 27°C = 300 K): ρ = 997 kg/m^{3}, c_{p} = 4179 J/kg . K, μ = 855 × 10^{-6} N . s/m^{2}, k = 0.613 W/m. K, Pr = 5.83.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysis:<br /> 1. The cooling water outlet temperature may be obtained from the overall energy bal-ance, Equation 11.7b. Accordingly,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(T_{c,o} = T_{c,i} + \frac{q}{\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c}}= 20°C + \frac{2 × 10^{9} W}{3 × 10^{4} kg/s × 4179 J/kg . K} \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(T_{c,o} = 36.0°C \)</span> <p class="blog">
2. The problem may be classified as one requiring a heat exchanger design calculation. First, we determine the overall heat transfer coefficient for use in the NTU method. From Equation 11.5</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \frac{1}{UA} = \frac{1}{U_i A_i} = \frac{1}{U_o A_o} = \frac{1}{h_i A_i} + \frac{R^{\prime \prime}_{f,i}}{A_i} + \frac{\ln (D_o /D_i)}{2\pi kL} +\frac{R^{\prime \prime}_{f,o}}{A_o} + \frac{1}{h_o A_o} \)</span> (11.5)</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( U = \frac{1}{(1/h_{i}) +( 1/h_{o})} \)</span> <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(h_{i}\)</span> may be estimated from an internal flow correlation. With</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Re_{D} = \frac{ 4 \dot{m} }{π D μ} = \frac{ 4 × 1 kg/s}{π (0.025 m)855 × 10^{-6} N . s/m^{2}} = 59,567 \)</span> <p class="blog">
the flow is turbulent and from Equation 8.60</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Nu_{D} = 0.023 Re^{4/5}_{D} Pr^{ 0.4} = 0.023(59,567)^{0.8}(5.83)^{0.4} = 308 \)</span> <p class="blog">
Hence</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(h_{i} = Nu_{D} \frac{k}{D }= 308\frac{0.613 W/m. K}{0.025 m } = 7543 W/m^{2} . K\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( U = \frac{1}{[(1/7543) + (1/11,000)] m^{2} . K/W}= 4474 W/m^{2} . K \)</span> <p class="blog">
Using the design calculation methodology, we note that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(C_{h} = C_{max} = ∞\)</span> <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(C_{min} =\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} = 3 × 10^{4}kg/s × 4179 J/kg . K = 1.25 × 10^{8}W/K\)</span> <p class="blog">
from which</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{C_{min}}{C_{max}} = C_{r} = 0\)</span> <p class="blog">
The maximum possible heat transfer rate is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(q_{max} = C_{min}(T_{h,i} &#8211; T_{c,i}) = 1.25 × 10^{8}W/K × (50 &#8211; 20) K = 3.76 × 10^{9} W\)</span> <p class="blog">
from which</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon = \frac{q}{q_{max}} =\frac{2 × 10^{9} W}{3.76 × 10^{9} W} =0.532 \)</span> <p class="blog">
From Equation 11.35b<span class="tex-text">\(NTU = &#8211; ln(1 &#8211; ε)\)</span> or Figure 11.12, we find NTU = 0.759. From Equation 11.24 <span class="tex-text">\(NTU \equiv \frac{UA}{C_{min}} \)</span>, it follows that the tube length per pass is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( L = \frac{NTU . C_{min} }{U(N2πD)} = \frac{0.759 × 1.25× 10^{8} W/K }{4474 W/m^{2} . K (30,000 × 2 × π× 0.025 m)}= 4.51 m\)</span> <p class="blog">
Comments:<br /> 1. Recognize that L is the tube length per pass, in which case the total length per tube is 9.0 m. The entire length of tubing in the condenser is N × L × 2 = 30,000× 4.51 m × 2 = 271,000 m or 271 km.<br /> 2. Over time, the performance of the heat exchanger would be degraded by fouling on both the inner and outer tube surfaces. A representative maintenance schedule would call for taking the heat exchanger off-line and cleaning the tubes when fouling factors reached values of <span class="tex-text">\(R^{\prime \prime }_{ƒ,i} = R^{\prime \prime }_{ƒ,o} = 10^{-4} m^{2} . K/W.\)</span> To determine the effect of fouling on perfor-mance, the ε-NTU method may be used to calculate the total heat rate as a function of the fouling factor, with <span class="tex-text">\(R^{\prime \prime }_{ƒ,o}\)</span> assumed to equal <span class="tex-text">\(R^{\prime \prime }_{ƒ,i}\)</span> . The following results are obtained:</p>
 <p class="blog">
To maintain the requirement of <span class="tex-text">\(q = 2 × 10^{9} W\)</span> with the maximum allowable fouling and the restriction of <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{m}_{c,1} = 1 kg/s\)</span>, the tube length or the number of tubes would have to be increased. Keeping the length per pass at L = 4.51 m, N = 48,300 tubes would be needed to transfer 2 109 W for <span class="tex-text">\(R^{\prime \prime }_{ƒ,i} = R^{\prime \prime }_{ƒ,o}= 10^{-4} m^{2} . K/W\)</span>. The corresponding increase in the total flow rate to <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{m}_{c} = N \dot{m}_{c,1} = 48,300 kg/s\)</span> would have the beneficial effect of reducing the water outlet temperature to <span class="tex-text">\(T_{c,o} = 29.9°C\)</span>, thereby ameliorating potentially harmful effects associated with discharge into the environment. The additional tube length associated with increasing the number of tubes to N = 48,300 is 165 km, which would result in a significant increase in the capital cost of the condenser.<br /> 3. The steam plant generates 1250 MW of electricity with a wholesale value of $0.05 per kW. h. If the plant is shut down for 48 hours to clean the condenser tubes, the loss in revenue for the plant’s owner is <span class="tex-text">\(48 h × 1250 × 10^{6} W × \$0.05/(1 × 103 W . h) = \$3 \)</span> million.<br /> 4. Assuming a smooth surface condition within each tube, the friction factor may be determined from Equation 8.21 <span class="tex-text">\(f = (0.790 ln Re_{D} &#8211; 1.64)^{-2} 3000\leq Re_{D} \leq 5 \times 10^{5} \)</span>, <span class="tex-text">\(f = (0.790 ln (59,567) &#8211; 1.64)^{-2} = 0.020\)</span>. The pres-sure drop within one tube of length L = 9 m may be determined from Equation 8.22a <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta p = &#8211; \int_{p_{1}}^{p_{2}}{dp } = f \frac{\rho u_{m}^{2}}{2 D} \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}{dp } = f \frac{\rho u_{m}^{2}}{2 D} ( x_{2}- x_{1})\)</span>, where <span class="tex-text">\(u_{m} = 4 \dot{m} / (ρ π D^{2}) = (4 × 1 kg/s)/(997 kg/m^{3} × π × 0.025^{2} m^{2})= 2.04 m/s \)</span>.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( Δp = f \frac{ρ u^{2}_{m}}{2 D} L = 0.020 \frac{997 kg/m^{3}(2.04 m/s)^{2}}{2(0.025 m)} 9.0 m = 15,300 N/m^{2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Therefore, the power required to pump the cooling water through the 48,300 tubes may be found by using Equation 8.22b <span class="tex-text">\( P = (\Delta p)\dot{∀} \)</span> and is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P = \frac{Δp \dot{m}}{ρ} = \frac{15,300 N/m^{2} × 48,300 kg/s}{997 kg/m^{3}} = 742,000 W = 0.742 MW\)</span> <p class="blog">
The cooling water pump is driven by an electric motor. If the combined efficiency of the pump and motor is 87%, the annual cost to overcome friction losses in the con-denser tubes is <span class="tex-text">\(24 h/day × 365 days/yr × 0.742 × 10^{6} W × \$0.05/1 × 10^{3} W. h/0.87 =\$374,000.\)</span><br /> 5. Optimal condenser designs are based on the desired thermal performance and environ-mental considerations as well as on the capital cost, operating cost, and maintenance cost associated with the device.</p>
