            <p class="blog"><strong>AGGREGATE PLANNING AT SURESTEP </strong></p> <p class="blog">During the next four months SureStep Company must meet (on time) the following demands for pairs of shoes: 3000 in month 1; 5000 in month 2; 2000 in month 3; and 1000 in month 4. At the beginning of month 1, 500 pairs of shoes are on hand, and SureStep has 100 workers. A worker is paid $1500 per month. Each worker can work up to 160 hours a month before he or she receives overtime. A worker can work up to 20 hours of overtime per month and is paid $13 per hour for overtime labor. It takes four hours of labor and $15 of raw material to produce a pair of shoes. At the beginning of each month, workers can be hired or fired. Each hired worker costs $1600, and each fired worker costs $2000. At the end of each month, a holding cost of $3 per pair of shoes left in inventory is incurred. All production in a given month can be used to meet that month’s demand. SureStep wants to determine its optimal production schedule and labor policy.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To develop an optimization model that relates workforce and production decisions to monthly costs, and to find the minimum-cost solution that meets forecasted demands on time and stays within limits on overtime hours and production capacity.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">There are a number of required inputs for this type of problem. Some, including initial inventory, holding costs, and demands, are similar to requirements for  in the previous chapter, so we won’t discuss them again here. Others might be obtained as follows.</p> <p class="blog">• The data on the current number of workers, the regular hours per worker per month, the regular hourly wage rates, and the overtime hourly rate, should be well known. The maximum number of overtime hours per worker per month is probably either the result of a policy decision by management or a clause in the workers’ contracts.</p> <p class="blog">• The costs for hiring and firing a worker are not trivial. The hiring cost includes training costs and the cost of decreased productivity due to the fact that a new worker must learn the job. The firing cost includes severance costs and costs due to loss of morale. Neither the hiring nor the firing cost would be simple to estimate accurately, but the human resources department should be able to estimate their values.</p> <p class="blog">• The unit production cost is a combination of two inputs: the raw material cost per pair of shoes and the labor hours per pair of shoes. The raw material cost is the going rate from the supplier(s). The labor per pair of shoes represents the “production function”—the average labor required to produce a unit of the product. The operations managers should be able to supply this number.</p>

A diagram for this model appears in Figure 14.27. (See the file Aggregate Planning Big Picture. xlsx.) It is divided into three parts: a section for workers, a section for shoes, and a section relating workers to shoe production. As you see, there are many variables to keep track of. In fact, the most difficult aspect of modeling this problem is knowing which variables the company gets to choose—the decision variables—and which variables are determined by these decisions. It should be clear that the company gets to choose the number of workers to hire and fire and the number of shoes to produce. Also, because management sets only an upper limit on overtime hours, it gets to decide how many overtime hours to use within this limit. But once</p>
 <p class="blog">
The key to this model is choosing the decision variables that determine the required outputs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
it decides the values of these variables, everything else is determined. We will show how these are determined through detailed cell formulas, but you should mentally go through the yellow calculated values (those in rounded rectangles) and deduce how they are determined by the decision variables. Also, you should convince yourself that the three constraints listed are the ones, and the only ones, that are required.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model appears in Figure 14.28. (See the file Aggregate Planning 1 Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs and range names. Enter the input data and create the range names listed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Production, hiring, and firing plan. Enter any trial values for the number of pairs of shoes produced each month, the overtime hours used each month, the workers hired each month, and the workers fired each month. These four ranges, in rows 18, 19, 23, and 30, comprise the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Workers available each month. In cell B17 enter the initial number of workers available with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B5</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the number of workers available at the beginning of any other month (before hiring and firing) is equal to the number of workers from the previous month, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B20</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C17 and copy it to the range D17:E17. Then calculate the number of workers available in month 1 (after hiring and firing) in cell B20 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B171B18-B19</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy this formula to the range C20:E20 for the other months.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Overtime capacity. Because each available worker can work up to 20 hours of overtime in a month, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$7*B20</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B25 and copy it to the range C25:E25.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This is common in multiperiod problems. You usually have to relate a beginning value in one period to an ending value from the previous period.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Production capacity. Because each worker can work 160 regular-time hours per month, calculate the regular-time hours available in month 1 in cell B22 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$6*B20</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy it to the range C22:E22 for the other months. Then calculate the total hours available for production in cell B27 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(B22:B23)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy it to the range C27:E27 for the other months. Finally, because it takes four hours of labor to make a pair of shoes, calculate the production capacity in month 1 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B27/$B$12</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B32 and copy it to the range C32:E32.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Inventory each month. Calculate the inventory after production in month 1 (which is available to meet month 1 demand) with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B41B30</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B34. For any other month, the inventory after production is the previous month’s ending inventory plus that month’s production, so enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B371C30</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C34 and copy it to the range D34:E34. Then calculate the month 1 ending inventory in cell B37 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B34-B36</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy it to the range C37:E37.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In  from the previous chapter, production capacities were given inputs. Now they are based on the size of the workforce, which itself is a decision variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. Monthly costs. Calculate the various costs shown in rows 40 through 45 for month 1 by entering the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$8*B18<br /> =$B$9*B19<br /> =$B$10*B20<br /> =$B$11*B23<br /> =$B$13*B30<br /> =$B$14*B37</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B40 through B45. Then copy the range B40:B45 to the range C40:E45 to calculate these costs for the other months.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8. Totals. In row 46 and column F, use the SUM function to calculate cost totals, with the value in F46 being the overall total cost to minimize.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Calculating Row and Column Sums with AutoSum</p>
 <p class="blog">
A common operation in spreadsheet models is to calculate row and column sums for a rectangular range, as we did for costs in step 8. There is a very quick way to do this. Select the row and column where the sums will go (remember to press the Ctrl key to select nonadjacent ranges) and click the AutoSum <span class="tex-text">\((\Sigma)\)</span> button. This enters all of the sums automatically. It even calculates the “grand sum” in the corner (cell F46 in the example) if this cell is part of the selection.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box should be filled in as shown in Figure 14.29. Note that the decision variable cells include four separate named ranges. To enter these in the dialog box, drag the four ranges, keeping your finger on the Ctrl key. (Alternatively, you can drag a range, type a comma, drag a second range, type another comma, and so on.) As usual, you should also check the Non-Negative option and select the Simplex LP method before optimizing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that there are integer constraints on the numbers hired and fired. You could also constrain the numbers of shoes produced to be integers. However, integer constraints typically require longer solution times. Therefore, it is often best to omit such constraints, especially when the optimal values are fairly large, such as the production quantities in this model. If the solution then has noninteger values, you can usually round them to integers for a solution that is at least close to the optimal integer solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution is given in Figure 14.28. Observe that SureStep should never hire any workers, and it should fire six workers in month 1, one worker in month 2, and 43 workers in month 3. Eighty hours of overtime are used, but only in month 2. The company produces over 3700 pairs of shoes during each of the first 2 months, 2000 pairs in month 3, and 1000 pairs in month 4. A total cost of $692,820 is incurred. The Solver solution will recommend overtime hours only when regular-time production capacity is exhausted. This is because overtime labor is more expensive.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Again, you would probably not force the number of pairs of shoes produced each month to be an integer. It makes little difference whether the company produces 3760 or 3761 pairs of shoes during a month, and forcing each month’s shoe production to be an integer can greatly increase the time Solver needs to find an optimal solution. On the other hand, it is somewhat more important to ensure that the numbers of workers hired and fired each month are integers, given the relatively small numbers of workers involved.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, if you want to ensure that Solver finds the optimal solution in a problem where some or all of the decision variable cells must be integers, you should go into Options (in the Solver dialog box) and make sure the Integer Optimality is set to zero. Otherwise, Solver might stop when it finds a solution that is only close to optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because integer constraints make a model more difficult to solve, use them sparingly—only when they are really needed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
There are many possible sensitivity analyses for this SureStep model. We illustrate one of them with SolverTable, where we see how the overtime hours used and the total cost vary with the overtime wage rate.<span class="tex-text">\(^{8}\)</span> The results appear in Figure 14.30. When the wage rate is really low, the company uses considerably more overtime hours, whereas when it is sufficiently large, the company uses no overtime hours. It is not surprising that the company uses much more overtime when the overtime rate is $7 or $9 per hour. The regular-time wage rate is $9.375 per hour (= 1500/160). Of course, the company would never pay less per hour for overtime than for regular time.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>The Rolling Planning Horizon Approach</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In reality, an aggregate planning model is usually implemented via a rolling planning horizon. To illustrate, we assume that SureStep works with a four-month planning horizon. To implement the SureStep model in the rolling planning horizon context, we view the demands as forecasts and solve a four-month model with these forecasts. However, the company would implement only the month 1 production and work scheduling recommendation. Thus (assuming that the numbers of workers hired and fired in a month must be integers) the company would hire no workers, fire six workers, and produce 3760 pairs of shoes with regular-time labor in month 1. Next, the company would observe month 1’s actual demand. Suppose it is 2950. Then SureStep would begin month 2 with 1310 (= 4260 &#8211; 2950) pairs of shoes and 94 workers. It would now enter 1310 in cell B4 and 94 in cell B5 (referring to Figure 14.28). Then it would replace the demands in the Demand range with the updated forecasts for the next four months. Finally, SureStep would rerun Solver and use the production levels and hiring and firing recommendations in column B as the production level and workforce policy for month 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The term “backlogging” means that the customer’s demand is met at a later date. The term “back-ordering” means the same thing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8 Solver’s sensitivity report isn’t even available here because of the integer constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Model with Backlogging Allowed</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In many situations, backlogging of demand is allowed—that is, customer demand can be met at a later date. We now show how to modify the SureStep model to include the option of backlogging demand. We assume that at the end of each month a cost of $20 is incurred for each unit of demand that remains unsatisfied at the end of the month. This is easily modeled by allowing a month’s ending inventory to be negative. For example, if month 1’s ending inventory is -10, a shortage cost of $200 (and no inventory holding cost) is incurred. To ensure that SureStep produces any shoes at all, we constrain the ending inventory in month 4 to be nonnegative. This implies that all demand is eventually satisfied by the end of the four-month planning horizon. We now need to modify the monthly cost calculations to incorporate costs due to backlogging.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are actually several modeling approaches to this backlogging problem. We show the most natural approach in Figure 14.31. (See the file Aggregate Planning 2 Finished. xlsx.) To begin, enter the per-unit monthly shortage cost in cell B15. (A new row was inserted for this cost input.) Note in row 38 how the ending inventory in months 1 through 3 can be positive (leftovers) or negative (shortages). You can account correctly for the resulting costs with IF functions in rows 46 and 47. For holding costs, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B38&gt;0,$B$14*B38,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B46 and copy it across. For shortage costs, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">

in cell B47 and copy it across. (The minus sign makes this a positive cost.)</p>

Although these formulas calculate holding and shortage costs accurately, the IF functions make the objective cell a nonlinear function of the decision variable cells, and Solver’s GRG nonlinear algorithm must be used, as indicated in Figure 14.32.<span class="tex-text">\(^{9}\)</span> (How do you know the model is nonlinear? Although there is a mathematical reason, it is easier to try running Solver with the simplex algorithm. Solver will then inform you that the model is nonlinear.)</p>

We ran Solver with this setup from a variety of initial solutions in the decision variable cells, and it always found the optimal solution. But we were lucky. When certain functions, including IF, MIN, MAX, and ABS, are used to relate the objective cell to the decision variable cells, the resulting model becomes not only nonlinear but nonsmooth. Essentially, nonsmooth functions can have sharp edges or discontinuities. Solver’s GRG nonlinear algorithm can handle “smooth” nonlinearities, but it has trouble with nonsmooth functions. Sometimes it gets lucky, as it did here, and other times it finds a nonoptimal solution that is not even close to the optimal solution. For example, we changed the unit shortage cost from $20 to $40 and reran Solver. Starting from a solution where all decision variable cells contain zero, Solver stopped at a solution with total cost $726,360, even though the optimal solution has total cost $692,820. So we weren’t so lucky this time.</p>

The moral is that you should avoid these nonsmooth functions in optimization models if at all possible. If you do use them, as we have done here, you should run Solver several times, starting from different initial solutions. There is still no guarantee that you will get the optimal solution, but you will see more evidence of how Solver is progressing. (Alternatively, you can use the Evolutionary Solver, which became a part of Excel’s Solver in Excel 2010. You can also use the Evolver add-in, part of Palisade’s DecisionTools® Suite.)</p>

9 GRG stands for generalized reduced gradient. This is a technical term for the mathematical algorithm used. The other algorithm available in Solver (starting with Excel 2010) is the Evolutionary algorithm. It can handle IF functions, but we will not discuss this algorithm here.</p>

Nonsmooth Functions</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is nothing inherently wrong with using IF, MIN, MAX, ABS, and other nonsmooth functions in spreadsheet optimization models. The problem is that Solver’s GRG nonlinear algorithm cannot handle these functions in a predictable manner.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are sometimes alternatives to using IF, MIN, MAX, and ABS functions that make a model linear. Unfortunately, these alternatives are often far from intuitive, and we will not cover them here. (If you are interested, we have included the “linearized” version of the backlogging model in the file Aggregate Planning 3 Finished.xlsx.)</p>
