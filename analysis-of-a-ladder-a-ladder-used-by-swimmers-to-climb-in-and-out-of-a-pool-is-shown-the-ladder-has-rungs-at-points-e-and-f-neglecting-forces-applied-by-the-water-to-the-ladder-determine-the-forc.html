Road Map Since the ladder contains at least one multiforce member, this structure must be analyzed as a frame. In fact, all three members of the ladder are multiforce members (three-force members, to be precise). What is challenging here is that point A is complicated—three members are joined by a single pin at this location. While we could disassemble the structure and draw FBDs for the three members only, for problems such as this where three or more members are supported by a single pin, it is especially helpful to draw a separate FBD for the pin. Hence, four FBDs will be used in our solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling We disassemble the structure into its three members plus the pin at A, which leads to the FBDs shown in Fig. 2. These FBDs are constructed as follows. Beginning with member AGD, point D is pin-supported so it has the usual two orthogonal reactions <span class="tex-text">\(D_x\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(D_y\)</span>. In addition, the member is supported by a pin at A; the pin applies forces <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1x}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1y}\)</span> to the member, and the member applies these same forces to the pin, but in opposite directions in accord with Newton’s third law. Next, member AFC is supported by a roller at C, so there is one reaction that is perpendicular to the wall of the pool. In addition, the member is supported by a pin at A: the pin applies forces <span class="tex-text">\(A_{2x}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(A_{2y}\)</span> to the member, and the member applies these same forces to the pin, but in opposite directions. The FBD for member AEB is similarly drawn.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation Examination of the FBDs shows that member AFC has only three unknown forces, and hence we choose this to begin writing equilibrium equations for it. Thus,</p>
 <p class="blog">
Member AFC:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_A}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-(30 lb)(8 in.) + C_x(9 in.) = 0 \Rightarrow C_x = 26.67 lb\)</span>, (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(A_{2y} &#8211; 30 lb = 0 \Rightarrow A_{2y} = 30.00 lb\)</span>, (2)</p>

 <p class="blog">
Examination of the remaining FBDs shows they each contain four unknowns, so there is no preferred order for treating them since a system of coupled algebraic equations will need to be solved. Thus, for the remaining three FBDs, the equilibrium equations are as follows:</p>

Discussion &amp; Verification</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Verification of solution. You should verify that the solution is mathematically correct by substituting forces into all equilibrium equations to check that each of them is satisfied. However, this check does not verify the accuracy of the equilibrium equations themselves, so it is essential that you draw accurate FBDs and check that your solution is reasonable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Alternate FBDs. The use of a separate FBD for the pin at A was helpful in this problem. However, other FBDs, provided they are properly drawn, can also be used. For example, if pin A is left on member AGD so that the remaining two members directly apply forces to AGD, then the FBDs are as shown in Fig. 3. You should sketch for yourself the FBDs that result if pin A is left on member AFC, or member AEB.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The bigger picture. The solution outlined here is the first step (a major first step) in fully designing and/or analyzing this pool ladder. In mechanics of materials, a subject that follows statics, you will use the forces determined here to investigate if the ladder is strong enough, if its deformations are acceptable, and so on.</p>
