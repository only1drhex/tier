The variables and constraints required for this blending model are shown in Figure 14.7. (See the file Blending Oil Big Picture.xlsx.). The key is the selection of the appropriate decision variables. You might think it is sufficient to specify the amounts of the two crude oils used and the amounts of the two products produced. However, this is not enough. The problem is that this information doesn’t tell Chandler how to make the outputs from the inputs. The company instead needs to have a blending plan: how much of each input to use in the production of a barrel of each output. Once you understand that this blending plan is the basic decision, all other output variables follow in a straightforward manner.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In typical blending problems, the correct decision variables are the amounts of each input blended into each output.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A secondary, but very important, issue in typical blending models is how to implement the quality constraints. (The constraints here are in terms of a generic “quality.” In other blending problems they are often expressed in terms of percentages of some ingredient(s). For example, a typical quality constraint is that some output can contain no more than 2% sulfur.) When we explain how to develop the spreadsheet model, we will discuss the preferred way of implementing the quality constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for this problem appears in Figure 14.8. (See the file Blending Oil Finished.xlsx.) To develop it, proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs and range names. Enter the unit selling prices, quality levels for inputs, required quality levels for outputs, and availabilities of inputs in the blue cells. Then name the ranges as indicated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Inputs blended into each output. The quantities Chandler must specify are the barrels of each input used to produce each output. Enter any trial values for these quantities in the Blending_plan range. For example, the value in cell B13 is the amount of crude oil 1 used to make gasoline and the value in cell C13 is the amount of crude oil 1 used to make heating oil. The Blending_plan range contains the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Inputs used and outputs sold. Calculate the row sums (in column D) and column sums (in row 15) of the Blending_plan range. There is a quick way to do this. Select both the row and column where the sums will go (select one, then hold down the Ctrl key and select the other), and click the AutoSum <span class="tex-text">\((\Sigma)\)</span> button on the Home ribbon. This creates SUM formulas in the selected cells. Then calculate the leftover barrels of each crude oil in column G by subtracting the amount used from the amount available.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Quality achieved. Keep track of the quality level of gasoline and heating oil in the Quality_ obtained range as follows. Begin by calculating for each output the average quality (AQ) in the inputs used to produce this output:</p>
 <p class="blog">
From here on, the solutions shown are optimal. However, remember that you can start with any solution. It doesn’t even have to be feasible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
AQ in gasoline = 10 * Oil 1 in gasoline + 5 * Oil 2 in gasoline</p>
 <p class="blog">
AQ in heating oil = 10 * Oil 1 in heating oil + 5 * Oil 2 in heating oil</p>
 <p class="blog">
The gasoline quality constraint is then</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { AQ in gasoline } \geq 8 * \text { Gasoline sold }\)</span> (14.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Similarly, the heating oil quality constraint is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { AQ in heating oil } \geq 6 * \text { Heating oil sold }\)</span> (14.2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
To implement Inequalities (14.1) and (14.2), calculate the AQ for gasoline in cell B19 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B13:B14,$C$4:$C$5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy this formula to cell C19 to generate the AQ for heating oil.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Quality required. Calculate the required average quality for gasoline and heating oil in cells B21 and C21. Specifically, determine the required average quality for gasoline in cell B21 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B9*B15</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy this formula to cell C21 for heating oil.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Revenue. Calculate the total revenue in cell B24 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B15:C15,B8:C8) + SUMPRODUCT(G13:G14,B4:B5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Fill out the main Solver dialog box as shown in Figure 14.9. As usual, check the Non-Negative option and select the Simplex LP method before optimizing. You should obtain the optimal solution shown in Figure 14.8.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution implies that Chandler should make 5000 barrels of gasoline with 3000 barrels of crude oil 1 and 2000 barrels of crude oil 2. The company should also make 10,000 barrels of heating oil with 2000 barrels of crude oil 1 and 8000 barrels of crude oil 2. With this blend, Chandler will obtain a revenue of $975,000, all from selling gasoline and heating oil.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As stated previously, this problem is sufficiently complex to defy intuition. Clearly, gasoline is more profitable per barrel than heating oil, but given the crude availability and the quality constraints, it turns out that Chandler should sell twice as much heating oil as gasoline. This would have been very difficult to guess ahead of time.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This solution uses all of the inputs to produce outputs; no crude oils are left over to sell. However, if you change the value of crude oil 2 to $55 and rerun Solver, you will see a much different solution, where no heating oil is produced and a lot of crude oil 2 is left over for sale. (Try it to convince yourself.) Why would the cheaper crude oil 2 be sold rather than the more expensive crude oil 1? The reason is quality. Gasoline requires a higher quality, and crude oil 1 is able to deliver it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We perform two typical sensitivity analyses on this blending model. In each, we see how revenue and the amounts of the inputs and outputs sold vary. In the first analysis, we use the unit selling price of gasoline as the input and let it vary from $50 to $90 in increments of $5. The SolverTable results appear in Figure 14.10. Two things are of interest. First, as the price of gasoline increases from $55 to $65, Chandler starts producing gasoline and less heating oil, exactly as you would expect. Second, when the price of gasoline gets to $80 or more, no heating oil is produced, and leftover crude oil 2 is sold instead. Third, the revenue can only increase or stay the same, as the changes in column G (calculated manually) indicate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the second sensitivity analysis, we vary the availability of crude 1 from 2000 barrels to 20,000 barrels in increments of 1000 barrels. The resulting SolverTable output appears in Figure 14.11. These results make sense if you analyze them carefully. First, the revenue increases, but at a decreasing rate, as more crude 1 is available. This is a common occurrence in LP models. As more of a resource is made available, revenue can only increase or remain the same, but each extra unit of the resource produces less (or at least no more) revenue than the previous unit. Second, the amount of gasoline produced increases, whereas the amount of heating oil produced decreases. Here’s why: Crude 1 has a higher quality than crude 2, and gasoline requires higher quality. Gasoline also sells for a higher price. Therefore, as more crude 1 is available, Chandler can produce more gasoline, receive more revenue, and still meet quality standards. However, that there is one exception to this, when only 2000 barrels of crude oil 1 are available. In this case, no gasoline is sold and leftover crude oil 2 is sold instead.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>A Caution about Blending Constraints</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Before concluding this example, we discuss why the model is linear. The key is the implementation of the quality constraints, shown in Inequalities (14.1) and (14.2). To keep a model linear, each side of an inequality constraint must be a constant, the product of a constant and a variable, or a sum of such products. If the quality constraints are implemented as in Inequalities (14.1) and (14.2), the constraints are indeed linear. However, it is arguably more natural to rewrite this type of constraint by dividing through by the amount sold. For example, the modified gasoline constraint becomes</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\text { AQ in gasoline }}{\text { Gasoline sold }} \geq 8\)</span> (14.3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although this form of the constraint is perfectly valid—and is possibly more natural to many people—it has two drawbacks. First, it makes the model nonlinear. This is because the left side is no longer a sum of products; it involves a quotient. We prefer linear models whenever possible. Second, suppose it turns out that Chandler’s optimal solution calls for no gasoline to be sold. Then Inequality (14.3) involves division by zero, and this causes an error in Excel. Because of these two drawbacks, it is best to “clear denominators” in all such blending constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Clearing Denominators</p>
 <p class="blog">
Some constraints, particularly those that arise in blending models, are most naturally expressed in terms of ratios. For example, the percentage of sulfur in a product is a ratio: (amount of sulfur in product)/(total amount of product). This ratio could then be constrained to be less than or equal to 6%, for example. This is a perfectly valid way to express the constraint, but it has the undesirable effect of making the model nonlinear. The fix is simple: multiply through by the denominator of the ratio. This has the added benefit of ensuring that division by zero will not occur.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In reality, a company using a blending model would run the model periodically and set production on the basis of the current inventory of inputs and the current forecasts of demands and prices. Then the forecasts and the input levels would be updated, and the model would be run again to determine the next period’s production.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 To avoid being overly technical, we use the generic term quality level. In real oil blending, qualities of interest might be octane rating, viscosity, and others.</p>
