The graphs are shown in Figure 36.33. In each graph, a gap occurs where p = f, which we shall discuss. Note the similarity in the shapes—a result of the fact that image and object distances for both lenses are related according to the same equation—the thin lens equation.<br /> The curve in the upper right portion of the f=+10 cm graph corresponds to an object located on the front side of a lens, which we have drawn as the left side of the lens in our previous diagrams. When the object is at positive infinity, a real image forms at the focal point on the back side (the positive side) of the lens, q = f. (The incoming rays are parallel in this case.) As the object moves closer to the lens, the image moves farther from the lens, corresponding to the upward path of the curve. This continues until the object is located at the focal point on the near side of the lens. At this point, the rays leaving the lens are parallel, making the image infinitely far away. This is described in the graph by the asymptotic approach of the curve to the line p = f = 10 cm.<br /> As the object moves inside the focal point, the image becomes virtual and located near <span class="tex-text">\( q=-\infty \)</span>. We are now following the curve in the lower left portion of Figure 36.33a. As the object moves closer to the lens, the virtual image also moves closer to the lens. As p → 0, the image distance q also approaches 0. Now imagine that we bring the object to the back side of the lens, where p &lt; 0. The object is now a virtual object, so it must have been formed by some other lens. For all locations of the virtual object, the image distance is positive and less than the focal length. The final image is real, and its position approaches the focal point as p becomes more and more negative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The f =-10 cm graph shows that a distant real object forms an image at the focal point on the front side of the lens. As the object approaches the lens, the image remains virtual and moves closer to the lens. But as we continue toward the left end of the p axis, the object becomes virtual. As the position of this virtual object approaches the focal point, the image recedes toward infinity. As we pass the focal point, the image shifts from a location at positive infinity to one at negative infinity. Finally, as the virtual object continues moving away from the lens, the image is virtual, starts moving in from negative infinity, and approaches the focal point.</p>
