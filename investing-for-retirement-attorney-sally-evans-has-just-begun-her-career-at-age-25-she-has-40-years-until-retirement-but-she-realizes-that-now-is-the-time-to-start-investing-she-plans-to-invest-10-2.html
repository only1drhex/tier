            <p class="blog"><strong>INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT</strong></p> <p class="blog">Attorney Sally Evans has just begun her career. At age 25, she has 40 years until retirement, but she realizes that now is the time to start investing. She plans to invest $1000 at the beginning of each of the next 40 years. Each year, she plans to put fixed percentages—thesame each year—of this $1000 into stocks, Treasury bonds (T-bonds), and Treasury bills (T-bills). However, she is not sure which percentages to use. (We call these percentages investment weights.) She has historical annual returns from stocks, T-bonds, and T-bills from 1946 to 2007. These are listed in the file Retirement Planning.xlsx. This file also includes inflation rates for these years. For example, for 1993, the annual returns for stocks, T-bonds, and T-bills were 9.99%, 18.24%, and 2.90%, respectively, and the inflation rate was 2.75%. Sally would like to use simulation to help decide what investment weights to use, with the objective of achieving a large investment value, in today’s dollars, at the end of 40 years.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use simulation to estimate the value of Sally’s future investments, in today’s dollars, from several investment strategies in T-bills, T-bonds, and stocks.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">Historical returns and inflation rates, such as those quoted here, are available on the Web. In fact, you might want to find more recent data than we have provided here.</p>

The variables for this model appear in Figure 16.22. (See the file Retirement Planning Big Picture.xlsx.) The most difficult modeling aspect is settling on a way to use historical returns and inflation factors to generate future values of these quantities. We suggest using a scenario approach. You can think of each historical year as a possible scenario, where the scenario specifies the returns and inflation factor for that year. Then for any future year, you randomly choose one of these scenarios. It seems intuitive that more recent scenarios ought to have a greater chance of being chosen. To implement this idea, you can give a weight (not to be confused with the investment weights) to each scenario, starting with weight 1 for the most recent year, 2007. Then the weight for any year is a damping factor multiplied by the weight from the next year. For example, the weight for 1996 is the damping factor multiplied by the weight for 1997. To change these weights to probabilities, you can divide each weight by the sum of all the weights. The damping factor illustrated here is 0.98. Others could be used instead, and it is not clear which produces the most realistic results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can simulate future scenarios by randomly choosing past scenarios, giving higher probabilities to more recent scenarios.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The other difficult part of the solution is choosing “good” investment weights. This is really an optimization problem: find three weights that add to 1 and produce the largest mean final cash. (@RISK contains a powerful tool, RiskOptimizer, that solves this type of optimization–simulation problem, but we will not discuss it here.) This example illustrates several sets of weights, where some percentage is put into stocks and the remainder is split evenly between T-bonds and T-bills, and see which does best. You can try other sets if you like.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Without a tool like RiskOptimizer, you cannot find the “best” set of investment weights, but the simulation model lets you experiment with various sets of weights.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The historical data and the simulation model (each with some rows hidden) appear in Figures 16.23 and 16.24. (Again, see the file Retirement Planning Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the data in the blue regions of Figures 16.23 and 16.24.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Weights. The investment weights used for the model are in rows 10 through 12 of Figure 16.23. (For example, the first set puts 80% in stocks and 10% in each of T bonds and T-bills.) You can simulate all three sets of weights simultaneously with a RiskSimtable and VLOOKUP combination as follows. First, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable({1,2,3})</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell I16. Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=VLOOKUP($I$16,LTable1,2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell J16 and copy it to cells K16 and L16. Then modify the formulas in these latter two cells, changing the last argument of the VLOOKUP to 3 and 4, respectively. For example, the formula in cell L16 should end up as</p>
 <p class="blog">
=VLOOKUP($I$16,LTable1,4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The effect is that you can run three simulations, one for each set of weights in rows 10 through 12.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Probabilities. Enter value 1 in cell F66. Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$J$4*F66</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell F65 and copy it up to cell F5. Sum these values with the SUM function in cell F67. Then to convert them to probabilities (numbers that add to 1), enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=F5/$F$67</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell G5 and copy it down to cell G66. Note how the probabilities for more recent years are considerably larger. When scenarios are selected randomly, recent years will have a greater chance of being chosen. (The SUM formula in cell G67 confirms that the probabilities sum to 1.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Scenarios. Moving to the model in Figure 16.24, the goal is to simulate 40 scenarios in columns K through O, one for each year of Sally’s investing. To do this, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskDiscrete($A$5:$A$66,$G$5:$G$66)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=1+VLOOKUP($K24,LTable2,L$22)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells K24 and L24, and copy this latter formula to the range M24:O24. Then copy all of these formulas down to row 63. Make sure you understand how the RiskDiscrete and VLOOKUP functions combine to achieve the goal. (Also, check the list of range names used at the top of Figure 16.24.) The RiskDiscrete function randomly generates a year from column A, using the probabilities in column G. Then the VLOOKUP function captures the data from this year. (You add 1 to the VLOOKUP to get a value such as 1.08, rather than 0.08.) This is the key to the simulation. (By the way, do you see why Excel’s RANDBETWEEN function isn’t used to generate the years in column K? The reason is that this function makes all possible years equally likely, and the goal is to make more recent years more likely.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Beginning, ending cash. The bookkeeping part is straightforward. Begin by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=J5</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell J24 for the initial investment. Then enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=J24*SUMPRODUCT(Weights,L24:N24)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$J$51P24</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells P24 and J25 for ending cash in the first year and beginning cash in the second year. The former shows how the beginning cash grows in a given year. You should think it through carefully. The latter implies that Sally reinvests her previous money, plus she invests an additional $1000. Copy these formulas down columns J and P.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Deflators. You eventually need to deflate future dollars to today’s dollars. The proper way to do this is to calculate deflators (also called deflation factors). Do this by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=1/O24</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell Q24. Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Q24/O25</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell Q25 and copy it down. The effect is that the deflator for future year 20, say, in cell Q43, is 1 divided by the product of all 20 inflation factors up through that year. (This is similar to discounting for the time value of money, but the relevant discount rate, now the inflation rate, varies from year to year.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. Final cash. Calculate the final value in today’s dollars in cell K19 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=P63*Q63</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then designate this cell as an @RISK output cell.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong><br /> Set the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of simulations to 3 (one for each set of investment weights to be tested). Then run the simulation as usual.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong><br /> Summary results appear in Figure 16.25. The first simulation, which invests the most heavily in stocks, is easily the winner. Its mean final cash, slightly more than $155,000 in today’s dollars, is much greater than the means for the other two sets of weights. The first simulation also has a much larger upside potential (its 95th percentile is close to $368,000), and even its downside is slightly better than the others: Its 5th percentile is the best, and its minimum is only slightly worse than the minimum for the other sets of weights.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Nevertheless, the histogram for simulation 1 (put 80% in stocks), shown in Figure 16.26, indicates a lot of variability—and skewness—in the distribution of final cash. As in , the concept of value at risk (VaR) is useful. Recall that VaR 5% is defined as the 5th percentile of a distribution and is often the value investors worry about. Perhaps Sally should rerun the simulation with different investment weights, with an eye on the weights that increase her VaR 5%. Right now it is about $36,500—not too good considering that she invests $40,000 total. She might not like the prospect of a 5% chance of ending up with no more than this. We also encourage you to try running this simulation with other investment weights, both for the 40-year horizon and (after modifying the spreadsheet model slightly) for shorter time horizons such as 10 or 15 years. Even though the stock strategy appears to be best for a long horizon, it is not necessarily guaranteed to dominate for a shorter time horizon.</p>
