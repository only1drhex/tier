The formulation of the problem in the previous illustration permits solutions for various pressures, and the same MATHCAD program was used to obtain solutions for most of the pressure range. The results of such calculations are shown in the accompanying figure in terms of the molar extent of reaction X and the molar fraction of the total mixture that is liquid, denoted by f. There are several things to notice in the solution to this problem. First, for pressures above about 33 kPa there is no equilibrium vapor phase (i.e., f = 1). That is, the bubble point pressure of this equilibrium reacting mixture at 25ºC is 33 kPa, so for higher pressures only a liquid phase is present. Also, and only coincidentally, the reaction is essentially at completion (X = 2) at this pressure. At other temperatures and certainly for other reactions, the disappearance of the vapor phase and the point of essentially complete reaction would not coincide.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Second, at pressures below about 4.8 kPa there is no equilibrium liquid phase (i.e., f = 0); 4.8 kPa is the dew point pressure of this reacting mixture at 25ºC. Consequently, to solve for the equilibrium state of this system at pressures lower than 4.8 kPa, only vapor-phase chemical equilibrium needs to be considered without any phase equilibrium constraints. In this case, the mass balance equations are</p>

The solution to this equation in terms of the molar extent of reaction X is also plotted in the figure. There we see that the molar extent of reaction decreases rapidly with decreasing pressure. Notice, however, that while the molar extent of reaction curve is continuous at the dew point, its derivative with respect to pressure is not. That is, while the molar extents of reaction approaching the dew point pressure from lower pressures (only vapor present) and from higher pressures (vapor-liquid mixture present) converge to the same value at the dew point pressure, the two molar extent-of-reaction curves have different slopes at the dew point pressure. Mathematically, this is because there are different constraining equations in these two regions. At low pressures, when only vapor is present, one needs to solve only the chemical equilibrium equation to obtain the equilibrium molar extent of reaction. However, at higher pressures, the equations of chemical and phase equilibria must be simultaneously solved to find the equilibrium extent of reaction. One should not expect the solutions for the molar extents of reaction to have the same dependence on pressure in these two regions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Physically what is happening is that in the high-pressure region water is condensing and ammonia is being absorbed into this water. Therefore, at any molar extent of reaction X this results in higher mole fractions of nitrogen and hydrogen in the vapor when a liquid is present (since there are fewer moles of water and ammonia in the vapor) and a lower mole fraction of ammonia as it is dissolving into the condensed water. By the Le Chatelier-Braun principle, we would expect that at a given pressure, there would be a greater conversion of nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia when a liquid phase is also present than if only a vapor phase exists. Consequently, if we extrapolated the molar extent-of-reaction curve when only a vapor is present to higher pressures, it should be below the values when both the vapor and liquid are present. This is indeed what we see, and it explains why the two molar extent-of-reaction curves should have different slopes.</p>

[<span class="tex-text">\(\text { Using Aspen Plus }^R\)</span> with the folder Aspen Illustration&gt;Chapter 13&gt;13.4-2 on theWiley website for this book produces the results in the Excel file Illus 13.4-2.xlsx in that folder. Note that the results our quantitively and qualitatively different than those above. The difference is that since nitrogen and hydrogen are so much above their critical temperatures at 25◦C, Aspen Plus predicts there will be an appreciable gas phase containing these two components, and therefore a much lower molar extent of reaction and liquid fraction. It is not evident which set of results is correct without experimental measurement.]</p>
