            <p class="blog">Claudia works with Lockheed-Martin (LMCO) in the aircraft maintenance division. She is preparing for what she and her boss, the division chief, hope to be a new 10-year defense contract with the Air Force on long-range cargo aircraft. A key piece of equipment for maintenance operations is an avionics circuit diagnostics system. The current system was purchased 7 years ago on an earlier contract. It has no capital recovery costs remaining, and the following are reliable estimates: current market value = $70,000, remaining life of 3 more years, no salvage value, and AOC = $30,000 per year. The only options for this system are to replace it now or retain it for the full 3 additional years.</p> <p class="blog">Claudia has found that there is only one good challenger system. Its cost estimates are: first cost = $750,000, life = 10 years, S = 0, and AOC = $50,000 per year.<br /> Realizing the importance of accurate defender alternative cost estimates, Claudia asked the division chief what system would be a logical follow-on to the current one 3 years hence, if LMCO wins the contract. The chief predicted LMCO would purchase the very system she had identified as the challenger because it is the best on the market. The company would keep it for the entire 10 additional years for use on an extension of this contract or some other application that could recover the remaining 3 years of invested capital. Claudia interpreted the response to mean that the last 3 years would also be capital recovery years, but on some project other than this one. Claudia’s estimate of the first cost of this same system 3 years from now is $900,000. Additionally, the $50,000 per year AOC is the best estimate at this time.</p> <p class="blog">The division chief mentioned any study had to be conducted using the interest rate of 10%, as mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Perform a replacement study for the fixed contract period of 10 years.</p>

The study period is fixed at 10 years, so the intent of the replacement study assumptions is not present. This means the defender follow-on estimates are very important to the analysis.<br /> Further, any analyses to determine the ESL values are unnecessary since alternative lives are already set and no projected annual market values are available. The first step of the replacement study procedure is to define the options. Since the defender will be replaced now or in 3 years, there are only two options:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Challenger for all 10 years.<br /> 2. Defender for 3 years, followed by the challenger for 7 years.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Cash flows are diagrammed in Figure 11–7. For option 1, the challenger is used for all 10 years. Equation [11.3]</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { Total } \mathbf{A W}_{k}=-P(\boldsymbol{A} / \boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{k})+\boldsymbol{S}_{k}(\boldsymbol{A} / \boldsymbol{F}, \boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{k})-\left[\sum_{j=1}^{[j=k} \mathbf{A O C}_{f}(\boldsymbol{P} / \boldsymbol{F}, i, \boldsymbol{j})\right](\boldsymbol{A} / \boldsymbol{P}, i, k) \quad[\mathbf{1 1} . \mathbf{3}]\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
is applied to calculate AW using the following estimates:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px">Challenger: P = $−750,000 AOC = $−50,000<br /> n = 10 years S = 0</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(AW_{C} = −750,000(A∕P,10%,10) − 50,000 =\)</span> $−172,063</p>
 <p class="blog">
The second option has more complex cost estimates. The AW for the in-place system is calculated over the first 3 years. Added to this is the capital recovery for the defender follow-on for<br /> the next 7 years. However in this case, the CR amount is determined over its full 10-year life. (It is not unusual for the recovery of invested capital to be moved between projects, especially for contract work.) Refer to the AW components as <span class="tex-text">\(AW_{DC} \)</span>(subscript DC for defender current) and <span class="tex-text">\(AW_{DF}\)</span> (subscript DF for defender follow-on). The final cash flows are shown in Figure 11–7b.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px">Defender current: market value = $−70,000 AOC = $−30,000 n = 3 years S = 0</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(AW_{DC}= [−70,000 − 30,000(P∕A,10\%,3)](A∕P,10\%,10) = \$−23,534\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Defender follow-on: P = $−900,000, n = 10 years for capital recovery calculation only, AOC = $–50,000 for years 4 through 10, S = 0.<br /> The CR and AW for all 10 years are</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(CR_{DF} = −900,000(A∕P,10\%,10) = \$−146,475\)</span> &#8230;&#8230;.[11.6].</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(AW_{DF} = (−146,475 − 50,000)(F∕A,10\%,7)(A∕F,10\%,10) = \$−116,966\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Total <span class="tex-text">\(AW_{D}\)</span> for the defender is the sum of the two annual worth values above. This is the AW for option 2.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(AW_{D} = AW_{DC} + AW_{DF} = −23,534 − 116,966 =\)</span>$−140,500</p>
 <p class="blog">
Option 2 has a lower cost ($−140,500 vs. $−172,063). Retain the defender now and expect to purchase the follow-on system 3 years hence.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comment</strong><br /> The capital recovery cost for the defender follow-on will be borne by some yet-to-be-identified project for years 11 through 13. If this assumption were not made, its capital recovery cost would be calculated over 7 years, not 10, in Equation [11.6], increasing CR to $−184,869. This raises the annual worth to <span class="tex-text">\(AW_{D}= \$−163,357\)</span>. The defender alternative (option 2) is still selected.</p>
