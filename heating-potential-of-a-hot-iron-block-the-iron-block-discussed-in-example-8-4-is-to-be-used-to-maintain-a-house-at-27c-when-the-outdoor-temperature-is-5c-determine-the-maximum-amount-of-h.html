The iron block is now reconsidered for heating a house. The maximum amount of heating this block can provide is to be determined.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em><strong>Analysis</strong> </em>Probably the first thought that comes to mind to make the most use of the energy stored in the iron block is to take it inside and let it cool in the house, as shown in Fig. 8-14, transferring its sensible energy as heat to the indoors air (provided that it meets the approval of the household, of course). The iron block can keep &#8220;losing&#8221; heat until its temperature drops to the indoor temperature of 27°C, transferring a total of 38,925 kJ of heat. Since we utilized the entire energy of the iron block available for heating without wasting a single kilojoule, it seems like we have a 100-percent-efficient operation, and nothing can beat this, right? Well, not quite.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In  we determined that this process has an irreversibility of 8191 kJ, which implies that things are not as &#8220;perfect&#8221; as they seem. A &#8220;perfect&#8221; process is one that involves &#8220;zero&#8221; irreversibility. The irreversibility in this process is associated with the heat transfer through a finite temperature difference that can be eliminated by running a reversible heat engine between the iron block and the indoor air. This heat engine produces (as determined in ) 8191 kJ of work and reject the remaining 38,925-8191=30,734 kJ of heat to the house. Now we managed to eliminate the irreversibility and ended up with 8191 kJ of work. What can we do with this work? Well, at worst we can convert it to heat by running a paddle wheel, for example, creating an equal amount of irreversibility. Or we can supply this work to a heat pump that transports heat from the outdoors at 5°C to the indoors at 27°C . Such a heat pump, if reversible, has a coefficient of performance of</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{HP}}=\frac{1}{1-T_{L} / T_{H}}=\frac{1}{1-(278 \mathrm{~K}) /(300 \mathrm{~K})}=13.6\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
That is, this heat pump can supply the house with 13.6 times the energy it consumes as work. In our case, it will consume the 8191 kJ of work and deliver 8191 × 13.6=111,398 kJ of heat to the house. Therefore, the hot iron block has the potential to supply</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\((30,734+111,398) \mathrm{kJ}=142,132 \mathrm{~kJ} \cong 142 \mathrm{MJ}\)</span> <p class="blog">

of heat to the house. The irreversibility for this process is zero, and this is the best we can do under the specified conditions. A similar argument can be given for the electric heating of residential or commercial buildings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em><strong>Discussion</strong> </em>Now try to answer the following question: What would happen if the heat engine were operated between the iron block and the outside air instead of the house until the temperature of the iron block fell to 27°C?<br /> Would the amount of heat supplied to the house still be 142 MJ? Here is a hint: The initial and final states in both cases are the same, and the irreversibility for both cases is zero.</p>
