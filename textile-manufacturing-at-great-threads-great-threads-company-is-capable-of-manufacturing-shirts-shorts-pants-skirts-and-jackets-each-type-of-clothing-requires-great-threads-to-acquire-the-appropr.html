The variables and constraints required for this model are shown in Figure 14.50. (See the file Fixed Cost Manufacturing Big Picture.xlsx.) Note that the cost of producing x shirts during a week is 0 if <span class="tex-text">\(x=0, \text { but it is } 1500+20 x \text { if } x&gt;0\)</span>. This cost structure violates the proportionality assumption (discussed in the previous chapter) that is needed for a linear model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If proportionality were satisfied, the cost of making, say, 10 shirts would be double the cost of making five shirts. However, because of the fixed cost, the total cost of making five shirts is $1600, and the cost of making 10 shirts is only $1700. This violation of proportionality requires you to use binary variables to obtain a linear model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model, shown in Figure 14.51, can now be developed as follows. (See the file Fixed Cost Manufacturing Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the given inputs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Binary values for clothing types. Enter any trial values for the binary variables for the various clothing types in the Rent_equipment range. For example, a 1 in cell C14 implies that the machinery for making shorts is rented and its fixed cost is incurred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Production quantities. Enter any trial values for the numbers of the various clothing types produced in the Units_produced range. At this point you could enter “illegal” values, such as 0 in cell B14 and a positive value in cell B16. This is illegal because it implies that the company produces some shirts but doesn’t incur the fixed cost of the machinery for shirts. However, Solver will eventually disallow such illegal combinations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Labor and cloth used. In cell B22 enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B5:F5,Units_produced)</p>
 <p class="blog">
to calculate total labor hours, and copy this to cell B23 for cloth.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Effective capacities. Here is the tricky part of the model. You need to ensure that if any of a given type of clothing is produced, then its binary variable equals 1. This ensures that the model incurs the fixed cost of renting the machine for this type of clothing. You could easily implement these constraints with IF statements. For example, to implement the constraint for shirts, you could enter the following formula in cell B14:</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16+0,1,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, Solver is unable to deal with IF functions predictably. Therefore, the fixed-cost constraints are modeled in a different way, as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { Shirts produced } \leq \text { Maximum capacity } \times(0-1 \text { variable for shirts) }\)</span> (14.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are similar inequalities for the other types of clothing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here is the logic behind Inequality (14.4). If the 0–1 variable for shirts is 0, the right side of the inequality is 0, which means that the left side must be 0—no shirts can be produced. That is, if the binary variable for shirts is 0, so that no fixed cost for shirts is incurred, then Inequality (14.4) does not allow Great Threads to “cheat” and produce a positive number of shirts. On the other hand, if the binary variable for shirts is 1, the inequality is certainly true and is essentially redundant. It simply states that the number of shirts produced must be no greater than the maximum number that could be produced. Inequality (14.4) rules out the one case that needs to be ruled out—namely, that Great Threads produces shirts but avoids the fixed cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To implement Inequality (14.4), a maximum capacity is required. To obtain this, suppose the company puts all of its resources into producing shirts. Then the number of shirts that can be produced is limited by the smaller of</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{ \text{Available labor hours} }{\text{Labor hours per shirt}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{ \text{Available square yards of cloth} }{\text{Square yards of cloth per shirt}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the smaller of these—the most limiting—can be used as the maximum needed in Inequality (14.4). To implement this logic, calculate the effective capacity for shirts in cell B18 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B14*MIN($D$22/B5,$D$23/B6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then copy this formula to the range C16:F16 for the other types of clothing.<span class="tex-text">\(^{15}\)</span> By the way, this MIN formula causes no problems for Solver because it does not involve decision variable cells, only input cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Monetary values. Calculate the total sales revenue and the total variable cost by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B8:F8, Units_produced)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B26 and copying it to cell B27. Then calculate the total fixed cost in cell B28 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B10:F10, Rent_equipment)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula sums the fixed costs only for those products with binary variables equal to 1. Finally, calculate the total profit in cell B29 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B26-B27-B28</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 14.52. The goal is to maximize profit, subject to using no more labor hours or cloth than are available, and ensure that production is less than or equal to effective capacity. The key is that this effective capacity is zero if none of a given type of clothing is produced. As usual, check the Non-Negative option, and set the Integer Optimality to zero (under the Options button). By the clever use of binary decision variables, the resulting model is linear, which means that the simplex algorithm can be used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although Solver finds the optimal solution automatically, you should understand the effect of the logical upper-bound constraint on production. It rules out a solution such as the one shown in Figure 14.53. This solution calls for a positive production level of pants but does not incur the fixed cost of the pants equipment. The logical upper-bound constraint rules this out because it prevents a positive value in row 16 if the corresponding binary value in row 14 is 0. In other words, if the company wants to produce some pants, the constraint in Inequality (14.4) forces the associated binary variable to be 1, thus incurring the fixed cost for pants.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Inequality (14.4) does not rule out the situation you see for skirts, where the binary value is 1 and the production level is 0. However, Solver will never choose this type of solution as optimal. Solver recognizes that the binary value in this case can be changed to 0, so that the fixed cost for skirt equipment is not incurred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution appears in Figure 14.51. It indicates that Great Threads should produce about 966 shorts and 379 jackets, but no shirts, pants, or skirts. The total profit is $54,614. The binary variables for shirts, pants, and skirts are all 0, which forces production of these products to be 0. However, the binary variables for shorts and jackets, the products that are produced, are 1. This ensures that the fixed cost of producing shorts and jackets is included in the total cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It might be helpful to think of this solution as occurring in two stages. In the first stage Solver determines which products to produce—in this case, shorts and jackets only. Then in the second stage, Solver decides how many shorts and jackets to produce. If you knew that the company plans to produce shorts and jackets only, you could then ignore the fixed costs and determine the best production quantities with the same types of product mix models discussed in the previous chapter. However, these two stages—deciding which products to produce and how many of each to produce—are interrelated, and Solver considers both of them in its solution process.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Great Threads management might not be very excited about producing shorts and jackets only. Suppose the company wants to ensure that at least three types of clothing are produced at positive levels. One approach is to add another constraint—namely, that the sum of the binary values in row 14 is greater than or equal to 3. You can check, however, that when this constraint is added and Solver is rerun, the binary variable for skirts becomes 1, but no skirts are produced. Shorts and jackets are more profitable than skirts, so only shorts and jackets are produced. (See Figure 14.54.) The new constraint forces Great Threads to rent an extra piece of machinery (for skirts), but it doesn’t force the company to use it. To force the company to produce some skirts, you would also need to add a constraint on the value in E16, such as E16 &gt; 5 100. Any of these additional constraints will cost Great Threads money, but if, as a matter of policy, the company wants to produce more than two types of clothing, this is its only option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As always, adding constraints can only make the objective worse. In this case, it means decreased profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sensitivity Analysis</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the optimal solution currently calls for only shorts and jackets to be produced, an interesting sensitivity analysis is to see how much incentive is required for other products to be produced. One way to model this is to increase the selling price for a nonproduced product such as skirts in a one-way SolverTable. The results of this, keeping track of all binary variables and profit, are shown in Figure 14.55. When the selling price for skirts is $85 or less, the company continues to produce only shorts and jackets. However, when the selling price is $90 or greater, the company stops producing shorts and jackets and produces only skirts. You can check that the optimal production quantity of skirts is 1000 when the selling price of skirts is any value $90 or above. The only reason that the profits in Figure 14.55 increase from row 9 down is that the revenues from these 1000 skirts increase.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>A Model with IF Functions</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In case you are still not convinced that the binary variable approach is required, and you think IF functions could be used instead, take a look at the last sheet in the finished version of the file. The resulting model looks the same as in Figure 14.51, but it incorporates the following changes:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The binary range is no longer part of the decision variable cells range. Instead, the formula =IF(B16&gt;0,1,0) is entered in cell B14 and copied across to cell F14. Logically, this probably appears more natural. If a production quantity is positive, a 1 is entered in row 14, which means that the fixed cost is incurred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The effective capacities are calculated in row 18 with IF functions. Specifically, the formula =IF(B16&gt;0,MIN ($D$22/B5,$D$23/B6),0) is entered in cell B18 and copied across to cell F18.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The Solver dialog box is modified as shown in Figure 14.56. The Rent_equipment range is not part of the decision variable cells range, and there is no binary constraint. However, the simplex method cannot be used because the IF functions make the model nonlinear</p>
 <p class="blog">
When we ran Solver on this modified model, we found inconsistent results, depending on the initial production quantities entered in row 16. For example, when we entered initial values all equal to 0, the Solver solution was exactly that—all 0’s. Of course, this solution is terrible because it leads to a profit of $0. However, when we entered initial production quantities all equal to 100, Solver found the correct optimal solution, the same as in Figure 14.51. Was this just lucky? To check, we tried another initial solution, where the production quantities for shorts and jackets were 0, and the production quantities for shirts, pants, and skirts were all 500. In this case Solver found a solution where only skirts are produced. Of course, we know this is not optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Actually, the problem with using the GRG Nonlinear method indicated in Figure 14.56 is that this model is “nonsmooth,” and the GRG Nonlinear method doesn’t work well on nonsmooth models. Starting in Excel 2010, there is another option—the Evolutionary method. This method works well on nonsmooth models, but it guarantees only an approximately optimal solution, and it is relatively slow. It is not discussed further in this book.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In any case, the IF-function approach is not the way to go. Its success depends on the initial values in the decision variable cells, and this requires good (or lucky) guesses. The binary approach ensures that Solver finds the correct solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
15 Why not set the upper limit on shirts equal to a huge number like 1,000,000? The reason is that Solver works most efficiently when the upper limit is as tight—that is, as low—as possible. A tighter upper limit means fewer potential feasible solutions for Solver to search through.</p>
