Notice from  that even though the secondary voltage is larger than the primary voltage, the secondary current is smaller than the primary current. The secondary current in an ideal transformer is 180° out of phase with the primary current, since the field in the secondary just offsets the field in the primary. The phase relationship between the currents in the windings holds true no matter what the phase difference between the current and the voltage of the secondary. In fact, the phase difference, if any, between voltage and current in the secondary will be reflected back to the primary as an identical phase difference. Note that phase, however, can be selected according to how you pull the secondary out—see the following note.</p>
 <p class="blog">
NOTE ABOUT PHASE<br /> By now you may be a bit annoyed with the notion of phase. For example, to say that the primary voltage is out of phase with the secondary by 180° is a smack in the face of relativity. Couldn’t you simply wind the secondary winding in a different direction or, more easily, simply reverse the secondary leads to get an output that is within phase? The answer is yes. It is a relativity game with the transformer pins. Figure 3.99 shows two transformers that are identical in very way except for the winding direction of the secondary. The winding A arrangement, when tested with a common ground and oscilloscope, yields in-phase voltage, while the winding in B yields voltage and currents that are 180° out of phase with the primary. To avoid confusion, phase dots are used to tell you the relative orientation of the windings. The way to read the phase dots is that current goes into the primary dot and causes current to exit out the secondary dot. The following drawing should help give you a sense of the direction of current flow and polarities that are defined by the position of the primary and secondary phase dots.</p>

The transformer symbol actually isn’t fully defined until phase dots are included. If you don’t see them, either phase isn’t important in the circuit, or the author forgot to include them. In many applications, keeping track of phase between the primary and secondary is not important since the secondary stage doesn’t care about what the primary is doing. One the other hand, there are circuits whose secondary stages do indeed care and they won’t work properly if phase isn’t strictly adhered to. Usually these circuits have an additional linkage between the primary and secondary stages (e.g., transistor, capacitor additional transformer, etc.) and the fundamental operation<br /> of the circuit depends of interplay between the primary and secondary phase voltages. An example of a circuit that doesn’t care about the secondary phase is a dc power supply that uses a step-down transformer’s secondary to feed a rectifier stage. The rectifier stage doesn’t care about phase. An example of a circuit that does care about phase is a Joule Thief circuit that links the secondary to primary through a bipolar transistor stage. Google “Joule Thief” to check out this interesting circuit. You’ll also find phase dots frequently within radio circuitry where phase again is important.</p>
