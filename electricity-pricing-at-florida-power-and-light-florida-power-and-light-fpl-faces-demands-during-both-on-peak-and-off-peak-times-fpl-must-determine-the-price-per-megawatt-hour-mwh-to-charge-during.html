            <p class="blog"><strong>ELECTRICITY PRICING AT FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT </strong></p> <p class="blog">Florida Power and Light (FPL) faces demands during both on-peak and off-peak times. FPL must determine the price per megawatt hour (mWh) to charge during both on-peak and off-peak periods. The monthly demand for power during each period (in millions of mWh) is related to price as follows:</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(D_{p}=2.253-0.013 P_{p}+0.003 P_{o}\)</span> (14.5)</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(D_{o}=1.142-0.015 P_{o}+0.005 P_{p}\)</span> (14.6)</p> <p class="blog">Here, <span class="tex-text">\(D_{p} \text { and } P_{p}\)</span> are demand and price during on-peak times, whereas <span class="tex-text">\(D_{o} \text { and } P_{o}\)</span> are demand and price during off-peak times. Note from the signs of the coefficients that an increase in the on-peak price decreases the demand for power during the on-peak period but increases the demand for power during the off-peak period. Similarly, an increase in the price for the off-peak period decreases the demand for the off-peak period but increases the demand for the on-peak period. In economic terms, this implies that on-peak power and off-peak power are substitutes for one another. In addition, it costs FPL $75 per month to maintain one mWh of capacity. The company wants to determine a pricing strategy and a capacity level that maximize its monthly profit.</p> <p class="blog">The positive coefficients of prices in these demand equations indicate substitute behavior. A larger price for one product tends to induce customers to demand more of the other.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use a nonlinear model to determine prices and capacity when there are two different daily usage patterns: on-peak and off-peak.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">As usual, a cost accountant should be able to estimate the unit cost of capacity. The real difficulty here is estimating the demand functions in Equations (14.5) and (14.6). This requires either sufficient historical data on prices and demands (for both on-peak and off-peak periods) or educated guesses from management.</p>

The variables and constraints for this model are shown in Figure 14.62. (See the file Electricity Pricing Big Picture.xlsx.) The company must decide on two prices and the amount of capacity to maintain. Because this capacity level, once determined, is relevant for on-peak and off-peak periods, it must be large enough to meet demands for both periods. This is the reasoning behind the constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Due to the relationships between the demand and price variables, it is not obvious what FPL should do. The pricing decisions determine demand, and larger demand requires larger capacity, which costs money. In addition, revenue is price multiplied by demand, so it is not clear whether price should be low or high to increase revenue.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The capacity must be at least as large as the on-peak and off-peak demands. There is no incentive for the capacity to be larger than the maximum of these two demands.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model appears in Figure 14.63. (See the file Electricity Pricing Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the parameters of the demand functions and the cost of capacity in the light blue ranges.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Prices and capacity level. Enter any trial prices (per mWh) for on-peak and off-peak power in the Prices range, and enter any trial value for the capacity level in the Capacity cell. These are the three values FPL has control over, so they become the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Demands. Calculate the demand for the on-peak period by substituting into Equation (14.5). That is, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B6+SUMPRODUCT(Prices,C6:D6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B19. Similarly, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B7+SUMPRODUCT(Prices,C7:D7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C19 for the off-peak demand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Copy capacity. To indicate the capacity constraints, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Capacity</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B21 and C21. The reason for creating these links is that the two demand cells in row 19 need to be paired with two capacity cells in row 21 so that the Solver constraints can be specified appropriately. (Solver doesn’t allow a “two versus one” constraint such as B19:C19 &lt;= B15.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Monetary values. Calculate the daily revenue, cost of capacity, and profit in the corresponding cells with the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(Demands,Prices)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Capacity*B9</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B24-B25</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box should be filled in as shown in Figure 14.64. The goal is to maximize profit by setting appropriate prices and capacity and ensuring that demand never exceeds capacity. You should also check the Non-Negative option (prices and capacity cannot be negative), and you should select the GRG Nonlinear method. Again, this is because prices are multiplied by demands, which are functions of prices, so that profit is a nonlinear function of the prices.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver solution in Figure 14.63 indicates that FPL should charge $137.57 per mWh during the on-peak period and $75.85 during the off-peak-load period.<span class="tex-text">\(^{19}\)</span> These prices generate demands of 0.692 million mWh in both periods, which is therefore the capacity required. The cost of this capacity is $51.908 million. When this is subtracted from the revenue of $147.712 million, the monthly profit becomes $95.804 million.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To gain some insight into this solution, consider what happens if FPL changes the peakload price slightly from its optimal value of $137.57. If FPL decreases the price to $137, say, you can check that the on-peak demand increases to 0.700 and the off-peak demand decreases to 0.689. The net effect is that revenue increases slightly, to $148.118. However, the on-peak demand is now greater than capacity, so FPL must increase its capacity from 0.692 to 0.700. This increases the cost of capacity to $52.500, which more than offsets the increase in revenue. A similar chain of effects occurs if FPL increases the on-peak price to $138. In this case, on-peak demand decreases, off-peak demand increases, and total revenue decreases. Although FPL can get by with lower capacity, the net effect is slightly less profit. Fortunately, Solver evaluates these trade-offs for you when it finds the optimal solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Varying the values of the decision variables slightly from their optimal<br /> values sometimes provides insight into the optimal solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
It is not difficult to show that the constraints for this model are linear and the objective is a concave function. This is enough to guarantee that there are no local maxima that are not globally optimal. In short, this guarantees that the Solver solution is optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
To gain even more insight, you can use SolverTable to see the effects of changing the unit cost of capacity, allowing it to vary from $60 to $80 in increments of $2. The results appear in Figure 14.65. They indicate that as the cost of capacity increases, the on-peak and off-peak prices both increase, the capacity decreases, and profit decreases. The latter two effects are probably intuitive, but we challenge you to explain the effects on price.</p>
 <p class="blog">
19 With these prices, if a typical customer uses 1.5 mWh in a month, two-thirds of which is on-peak usage, the bill for the month will be $137.57 + $75.85/2=$175.50. This seems reasonable.</p>
