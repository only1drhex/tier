            <p class="blog">PREDATOR-PREY MODELS AND CHAOS (CIVIL/ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING)</p> <p class="blog">Environmental engineers deal with a variety of problems involving systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In this section, we will focus on two of these applications. The first relates to the so-called predator-prey models that are used to study the cycling of nutrient and toxic pollutants in aquatic food chains and biological treatment systems. The second are equations derived from fluid dynamics that are used to simulate the atmosphere. Aside from their obvious application to weather prediction, such equations have also been used to study air pollution and global climate change.<br /> Predator-prey models were developed independently in the early part of the twentieth century by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra and the American biologist Alfred J. Lotka. These equations are commonly called Lotka Volterra equations. The simplest example is the following pair of ODEs:</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{dx}{dt} = ax − bxy \)</span> (28.4)</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{dy}{dt}= −cy + dxy \)</span> (28.5)</p> <p class="blog">where x and y = the number of prey and of predators, respectively, a = the prey growth rate, c = the predator death rate, and b and d = the rate characterizing the effect of the predator-prey interaction on prey death and predator growth, respectively. The multiplicative terms (that is, those involving xy) are what make such equations nonlinear.</p> <p class="blog">An example of a simple model based on atmospheric fluid dynamics is the Lorenz equations developed by the American meteorologist Edward Lorenz,</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{dx}{dt} = −\sigma x + \sigma y \)</span> (28.6)</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{dy}{dt} = rx − y − xz \)</span> (28.7)</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{dz}{dt}= −bz + xy \)</span> (28.8)</p> <p class="blog">Lorenz developed these equations to relate the intensity of atmospheric fluid motion, x, to temperature variations y and z in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. As with the predator-prey model, we see that the nonlinearity is localized in simple multiplicative terms (xz and xy).<br /> Use numerical methods to obtain solutions for these equations. Plot the results to visualize how the dependent variables change temporally. In addition, plot the dependent variables versus each other to see whether any interesting patterns emerge.</p>

Use the following parameter values for the predator prey simulation: <span class="tex-text">\(a = 1.2, b = 0.6, c = 0.8\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(d = 0.3\)</span>. Employ initial conditions of <span class="tex-text">\(x = 2\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(y = 1\)</span> and integrate from <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0 to 30\)</span>. We will use the fourth-order RK method with double precision to obtain solutions.<br /> The results using a step size of 0.1 are shown in Fig. 28.7. Note that a cyclical pattern emerges. Thus, because predator population is initially small, the prey grows exponentially. At a certain point, the prey become so numerous, that the predator population begins to grow. Eventually, the increased predators cause the prey to decline. This decrease, in turn, leads to a decrease of the predators. Eventually, the process repeats.<br /> Notice that, as expected, the predator peak lags the prey. Also, observe that the process has a fixed period; that is, it repeats in a set time.<br /> Now, if the parameters used to simulate Fig. 28.7 were changed, although the general pattern would remain the same, the magnitudes of the peaks, lags, and period would change. Thus, there are an infinite number of cycles that could occur.<br /> A phase-plane representation is useful in discerning the underlying structure of the model. Rather than plotting x and y versus t, we can plot x versus y. This plot illustrates the way that the state variables (x and y) interact, and is referred to as a phase-plane representation.<br /> Figure 28.8 shows the phase-plane representation for the case we are studying. Thus, the interaction between the predator and the prey defines a closed counterclockwise orbit.<br /> Notice that there is a critical or rest point at the center of the orbit. The exact location of this point can be determined by setting Eqs. (28.4) and (28.5) to steady state <span class="tex-text">\((dy∕dt = dx∕dt = 0)\)</span> and solving for <span class="tex-text">\((x, y) = (0, 0)\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\((c∕d, a∕b)\)</span>. The former is the trivial result that if we start with neither predators nor prey, nothing will happen. The latter is the more interesting outcome that if the initial conditions are set at <span class="tex-text">\(x = c∕d\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(y = a∕b\)</span>, the derivative will be zero and the populations will remain constant.<br /> Now, let us use the same approach to investigate the trajectories of the Lorenz equations with the following parameter values: <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma = 10, b = 2.666667,\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(r = 28\)</span>. Employ initial conditions of <span class="tex-text">\(x = y = z = 5\)</span> and integrate from <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0 to 20.\)</span> Again, we will use the fourth-order RK method with double precision to obtain solutions.<br /> The results shown in Fig. 28.9 are quite different from the behavior of the LotkaVolterra equations. The variable x seems to be undergoing an almost random pattern of oscillations, bouncing around from negative values to positive values. However, even though the patterns seem random, the frequency of the oscillation and the amplitudes seem fairly consistent.<br /> Another interesting feature can be illustrated by changing the initial condition for <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> slightly (from 5 to 5.001). The results are superimposed as the dashed line in Fig. 28.9.<br /> Although the solutions track on each other for a time, after about <span class="tex-text">\(t = 12.5\)</span> they diverge significantly. Thus, we can see that the Lorenz equations are quite sensitive to their initial conditions. In his original study, this led Lorenz to the conclusion that long-range weather forecasts might be impossible!<br /> Finally, let us examine the phase-plane plots. Because we are dealing with three independent variables, we are limited to projections. Figure 28.10 shows projections in the <span class="tex-text">\(xy\)</span> and the <span class="tex-text">\(xz\)</span> planes. Notice how a structure is manifest when perceived from the phaseplane perspective. The solution forms orbits around what appear to be critical points.</p>
 <p class="blog">
These points are called strange attractors in the jargon of mathematicians who study such nonlinear systems.<br /> Solutions such as the type we have explored for the Lorenz equations are referred to as chaotic solutions. The study of chaos and nonlinear systems presently represents an exciting area of analysis that has implications to mathematics as well as to science and engineering.<br /> From a numerical perspective, the primary point is the sensitivity of such solutions to initial conditions. Thus, different numerical algorithms, computer precision, and integration time steps can all have an impact on the resulting numerical solution.</p>
