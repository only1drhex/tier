Create the Mesh and Solve the Problem</p>
 <ol start="13"> <li>L-click the Mesh node and note the Element size is Normal. L-click Build All. R-click Mesh, Statistics, and note there are 18,078 elements.</li> <li>R-click Study 1 and select Parametric sweep. In the Settings panel, locate the Study settings. At the bottom of the Parameter definition, L-click the plus icon to add a parameter to the study. You can now use the drop-down box to select nu1. Enter the values <span class="tex-text">\(1.077 \mathrm{e}-3,1.077 \mathrm{e}-4,1.077 \mathrm{e}-5\)</span>, in the parameter list and set the parameter unit to <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{ft}^{\wedge} 2 / \mathrm{s}\)</span> (note: brackets must not be used here &#8211; they will lead to an error notice). As a result, COMSOL will start with an artificially high viscosity (100 times its true value) in order to dampen out any instabilities, and then approach the solution by gradually decreasing the viscosity until its true value is reached. The intermediate value <span class="tex-text">\(1.077 \mathrm{e}-4\)</span> means that the current solution at that stage (when the viscosity is 10 times its true value) will be saved and will be available for eventual plotting if needed.</li> <li>R-click the Study node and select Compute. You can watch the progress of the solution by clicking on the Progress button under the Graphics window. Observe that there are 51,820 degrees of freedom &#8211; that is, the number of unknowns in the simultaneous nonlinear equations being solved (including any Dirichlet boundary conditions). The solution took about 5 minutes on the author&#8217;s Mac Book Pro computer. (For a similar solution using the &#8220;Coarse&#8221; mesh, there were 9,702 elements and 29,585 degrees of freedom, and the solution took about 1 minute.)</li> </ol> <p class="blog">

 <ol start="16"> <li>R-click Results and L-click 2D Plot Group. In the Settings window, select the final parameter of interest for the value of nu1, i.e., 1.077e-5 in the Data section.</li> <li>R-click the new 2D Plot Group 5 and L-click Mesh.

Pressure Cross-Plot</p>
 <ol start="24"> <li>Create a data set along the axis of symmetry. R-click Data Sets within the Results tree and select Cut Line 2D. In the Settings window, enter the values <span class="tex-text">\((0.0,0.0)\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\((0.0,0.5)\)</span>, each number being followed by [ft], for Points 1 and 2 . L-click Plot near the top of the Settings window to display the cut line.</li> <li>R-click Results and L-click 1D Plot Group. In the Settings window, Lclick the dropdown dialog and change the data set to Cut Line 2D 1.

<strong>Discussion of Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Fig. E9.4.2</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) The &#8220;normal&#8221; finite-element mesh was used for the calculations but is too fine to show any detail if reproduced here. Instead, we display an &#8220;extra coarse&#8221; mesh, containing 3,281 elements. Observe that COMSOL concentrates the elements near the walls, and especially at the orifice plate. It is in these locations that the highest velocity gradients will be encountered.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The streamlines represent the time-averaged motion, and not the paths taken by the water. Observe the contraction through the orifice and the very substantial recirculating eddy in the &#8220;backwater&#8221; just downstream of the orifice plate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The surface plot shows the magnitude of the velocity. Since some of the information from the original color is lost in black-and-white, we have added boxes that show general trends of values. Either by observing the original color bar at the right or by clicking on various parts of the diagram, the highest velocity is found to occur on the centerline, a little downstream from the orifice <span class="tex-text">\((0.05 \mathrm{~m}\)</span> or about <span class="tex-text">\(0.16 \mathrm{ft}\)</span> from the inlet), with a value of about <span class="tex-text">\(1.48\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> or <span class="tex-text">\(4.85 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}\)</span>, which compares with the inlet velocity of <span class="tex-text">\(1.0 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Fig. E9.4.3</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here, we present three more surface plots, perforce reduced from color to black-and-white, but with added labels that show relative magnitudes. In each case, there is a &#8220;plume&#8221; emanating from the orifice, in which the turbulent effects are greatly enhanced.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) In the plume, the turbulent (kinematic) viscosity, <span class="tex-text">\(\nu_{T}\)</span>, continues to increase in intensity all the way to the exit. The maximum value of <span class="tex-text">\(\nu_{T}\)</span> is about <span class="tex-text">\(5.9 \times 10^{-3}\)</span>, almost 550 times the molecular kinematic viscosity. The values can be placed in perspective by noting that <span class="tex-text">\(\nu_{T}=C_{\mu} k^{2} / \varepsilon\)</span>, and comparing <span class="tex-text">\(\nu_{T}\)</span> with <span class="tex-text">\(k\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon\)</span> from the turbulent kinetic energy <span class="tex-text">\((k)\)</span> and dissipation <span class="tex-text">\((e p)\)</span> figures.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The turbulent kinetic energy first continues to increase along the plume but has subsided considerably by the time the flow reaches the exit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The turbulent dissipation rate is extremely high at the orifice plate, and indeed its value there completely overshadows its value at all other locations. On a linear plot, there is an extremely high spot at the orifice plate, but the rate is low everywhere else. A much better idea of the distribution can be obtained by plotting the logarithm (to base <span class="tex-text">\(e\)</span> ) of <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon, \log (e p)\)</span>, as shown here. Note that the general distribution is roughly the same as that of the turbulent kinetic energy but that it decays somewhat faster.</p>

Here, we see a cross-plot of the pressure along the centerline, from inlet to exit. As the velocity increases from <span class="tex-text">\(1.0\)</span> to about <span class="tex-text">\(4.85 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}\)</span>, there is &#8212; from Bernoulli&#8217;s equation&#8212;a sharp but smooth reduction in pressure as the vena contracta is reached at <span class="tex-text">\(z \doteq 0.13 \mathrm{ft}\)</span>. Thereafter, as some kinetic energy is converted back to pressure energy, there is some recovery of pressure as the exit is approached, in agreement with the macroscopic analysis on page 87 .</p>
