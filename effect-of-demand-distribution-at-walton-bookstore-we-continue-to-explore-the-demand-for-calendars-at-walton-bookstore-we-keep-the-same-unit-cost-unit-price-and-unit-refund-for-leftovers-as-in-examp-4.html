It is important in this type of analysis to make a fair comparison. When you select a normal distribution for demand, you must choose a mean and standard deviation for this distribution. Which values should you choose? It seems only fair to choose the same mean and standard deviation that the triangular distribution has. To find the mean and standard deviation for a triangular distribution with given minimum, most likely, and maximum values, you can take advantage of @RISKâ€™s Define Distributions tool. Select any blank cell, click the Define Distributions button, select the triangular distribution, and enter the parameters 100, 175, and 300. You will see that the mean and standard deviation are 191.67 and 41.248, respectively. Therefore, for a fair comparison you should use a normal distribution with mean 191.67 and standard deviation 41.248. @RISK allows you to see a comparison of these two distributions, as in Figure 15.41. To get this chart, click the Add Overlay button, select the normal distribution from the gallery, and enter 191.67 and 41.248 as its mean and standard deviation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For a fair comparison of alternative input distributions, the distributions should have (at least approximately) equal means and standard deviations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The logic in this model is almost exactly the same as before. (See Figure 15.42 and the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; Different Demand Distributions Finished.xlsx.) However, a clever use of the RiskSimtable function allows you to run two simulations at once, one for the triangular distribution and one for the corresponding normal distribution. The following two steps are required.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Walton Model with Alternative Input Distributions</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. RiskSimtable function. It is useful to index the two distributions as 1 and 2. To indicate that you want to run the simulation with both of them, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable({1,2})</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B11. Remember that when you enter actual numbers in this function, rather than cell references, you must put curly brackets around the list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Look for ways to use the RiskSimtable function. It can really improve efficiency because it runs several simulations at once.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Demand. When the value in cell B11 is 1, the demand distribution is triangular. When it is 2, the distribution is normal. Therefore, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(IF(B11=1,RiskTriang(E4,E5,E6),RiskNormal(H4,H5)),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B15. The effect is that the first simulation will use the triangular distribution, and the second will use the normal distribution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The only @RISK setting to change is the number of simulations. It should now be set to 2, the number of values in the RiskSimtable formula. Other than this, you run the simulation exactly as before.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The comparison is shown numerically in Figure 15.43 and graphically in Figure 15.44. As you can see, there is more chance of really low profits when the demand distribution is normal, but each simulation results in the same maximum profit. Both of these statements make sense. The normal distribution, being unbounded on the left, allows for very low demands, and these occasional low demands result in very low profits. On the other side, Waltonâ€™s maximum profit is $500 regardless of the input distribution (provided that it allows demands greater than the order quantity). This occurs when Waltonâ€™s sells all it orders, in which case excess demand has no effect on profit. Note that the mean profits for the two distributions differ by only about $5.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is probably safe to conclude that the profit distribution in this model is not greatly affected by the choice of demand distribution, at least not when (1) the candidate input distributions have the same mean and standard deviation, and (2) their shapes are not too dissimilar. We would venture to guess that this general conclusion about insensitivity of output distributions to shapes of input distributions can be made in many simulation models. However, it is always worth checking, as we have done here, especially if there is a lot of money at stake.</p>
