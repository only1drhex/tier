We use this example to illustrate important features of @RISK. We first show how it helps you to implement an appropriate input probability distribution for demand. Then we show how it can be used to build a simulation model for a specific order quantity and generate outputs from this model. Finally, we show how the RiskSimtable function can be used to simultaneously generate outputs from several order quantities so that you can choose the optimal order quantity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for profit is essentially the same model developed previously without @ RISK, as shown in Figure 15.27. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; Basic Model Finished. xlsx.) There are only a few new things to be aware of.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Settings When Opening a Workbook</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you open a workbook with an @RISK model, such as those that accompany this chapter, you might be asked whether you want to change the current @RISK settings to match those stored in the workbook. You should generally click Yes. This changes settings, such as the number of iterations, to those you stored previously with the workbook instead of using @RISK default settings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Input distribution. To generate a random demand, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(RiskTriang(E4,E5,E6),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B13 for the random demand. This uses the RiskTriang function to generate a demand from the triangular distribution. (As before, our convention is to color random input cells green.) Excel’s ROUND function is used to round demand to the nearest integer. Recall from the discussion in Section 15-3 that Excel has no built-in functions to generate random numbers from a triangular distribution, but this is easy with @RISK.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Output cell. When the simulation runs, you want @RISK to keep track of profit. In @RISK’s terminology, you need to designate the Profit cell, F13, as an output cell. To do this, select cell F13 and then click the Add Output button on the @RISK ribbon. (See Figure 15.26.) This adds RiskOutput(“label”)+ to the cell’s formula. (Here, “label” is a label that @RISK uses for its reports. In this case it makes sense to use “Profit” as the label.) The formula in cell F13 changes from</p>
 <p class="blog">
=C13+E13-D13</p>
 <p class="blog">
to</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskOutput(‘‘Profit’’)+C13+E13-D13</p>
 <p class="blog">
The plus sign following RiskOutput is simply @RISK’s way of indicating that you want to keep track of the value in this cell (for reporting reasons) as the simulation progresses. Any number of cells can be designated in this way as output cells. They are typically the “bottom line” values of primary interest. Our convention is to color such cells gray.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The RiskOutput function indicates that a cell is an output cell, so that @RISK will keep track of its values throughout the simulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Summary functions (optional). There are several places where you can store @RISK results. One of these is to use @RISK statistical functions to place results in your model worksheet. @RISK provides several functions for summarizing output values. Some of these are illustrated in the range B16:B23 of Figure 15.27. They contain the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
These @RISK summary functions allow you to show simulation results on the same sheet as the model. However, they are totally optional.</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMin(F13)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMax(F13)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMean(F13)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskStddev(F13)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskPercentile(F13,0.05)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskPercentile(F13,0.95)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTarget(F13,300)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=1-RiskTarget(F13,400)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The values in these cells are not meaningful until you run the simulation (so do not be alarmed if they contain errors when you open the file). However, once the simulation runs, these formulas capture summary statistics of profit. For example, RiskMean calculates the average of the 1000 simulated profits, RiskPercentile finds the value such that the specified percentage of simulated profits are less than or equal to this value, and RiskTarget finds the percentage of simulated profits less than or equal to the specified value. Although these same summary statistics also appear in other @RISK reports, you might like to have them in the same worksheet as the model. (You can find a list of all @RISK statistical functions from the Simulation Result group in the Insert Function dropdown list on the @RISK ribbon.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Feature</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Color Coding</p>
 <p class="blog">
@RISK has an optional color coding feature. This option is in the Utilities group of the @RISK ribbon. It is a toggle. If it is toggled off, you see our blue/red/gray/green coloring. If it is toggled on, you see @RISK’s color coding: blue for random input cells, red for output cells, green for statistical functions, and yellow for decision cells (for RISKOptimizer models). @RISK even allows you to change the coloring scheme if you prefer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
After you develop the model, the rest is straightforward. The procedure is always the same: (1) specify simulation settings, (2) run the simulation, and (3) examine the results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Simulation settings. You must first choose some simulation settings. To do so, the buttons on the left in the Simulation group (see Figure 15.28) are useful. We typically do the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Set Iterations to a number such as 1000. (@RISK calls replications “iterations.”) Any number can be used, but because the academic version of @RISK allows only 1000 uninterrupted iterations, we typically choose 1000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Set Simulations to 1. In a later section, we will explain when you would request multiple simulations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The “dice” button is a toggle for what appears in your worksheet. If it is colored (Random), all random cells appear random (they change when you press the F9 key). If it is white (Static), only the means appear in random input cells and the F9 key has no effect. We tend to prefer the Random setting, but this setting is irrelevant when you run the simulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Many more settings are available by clicking the Simulation Settings button to the left of the “dice” button, but the ones we mentioned should suffice. In addition, more permanent settings can be chosen from Application Settings in the Utilities dropdown list on the @RISK ribbon. You can experiment with these, but the only one we like to change is the Place Reports In setting in the Reports group. The default is to place reports in a new workbook. If you like the reports to be in the same workbook as your model, you can change this setting to Active Workbook.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Leave Latin Hyper-cube sampling on. It produces more accurate results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Technical Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Latin Hypercube Sampling and Mersenne Twister Generator</p>
 <p class="blog">
Two settings you shouldn’t change are the Sampling Type and Generator settings (available from the Simulation Settings button and then the Sampling tab). They should remain at the default Latin Hypercube and Mersenne Twister settings. The Mersenne Twister is one of many algorithms for generating random numbers, and it has been shown to have very good statistical properties. (Not all random number generators do.) Latin Hypercube sampling is a more efficient way of sampling than the other option (Monte Carlo) because it produces a more accurate estimate of the output distribution. In fact, we were surprised how accurate it is. In repeated runs of this model, always using different random numbers, we virtually always got a mean profit within a few pennies of $337.50. It turns out that this is the true mean profit for this input distribution of demand. Amazingly, simulation estimates it correctly—almost exactly—on virtually every run. However, this means that a confidence interval for the mean, based on @RISK’s outputs and the usual confidence interval formula (which assumes Monte Carlo sampling), is much wider (more pessimistic) than it should be. Therefore, we do not even calculate such confidence intervals from here on. However, it is not impossible. The accompanying video explains a method called Batch Means for calculating confidence intervals when Latin Hypercube sampling is used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Run the simulation. To run the simulation, click the Start Simulation button on the @RISK ribbon. When you do so, @RISK repeatedly generates a random number for each random input cell, recalculates the worksheet, and keeps track of all output cell values. You can watch the progress at the bottom left of the screen. Also, if the Automatically Show Output Graph button (to the right of the dice button) is toggled to colored, you will see a histogram of the currently selected input or output cell being built as the simulation runs. If you find this annoying, you can toggle this button to white.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Examine the results. You must decide which results you want and where you want them. @RISK provides a lot of possibilities, and we mention the most frequently used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can ask for summary measures in your model worksheet by using the @RISK statistical functions, such as RiskMean, discussed earlier.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The quickest way to get results is to select an input or output cell (we chose the profit cell, F13) and then click the Browse Results button in the Results group of the @RISK ribbon. (See Figure 15.29.) This provides an interactive graph of the selected value, as shown in Figure 15.30. You can move the “sliders” (the two vertical bars) on this graph to see probabilities of various outcomes. The window you see from Browse Results is temporary—it goes away when you click Close. You can make a permanent copy of the chart by clicking the second button from the left (see the bottom of Figure 15.30) and choosing one of the copy options.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For a quick graph of the distribution of an output or input, select the output or input cell and click @RISK’s Browse Results button.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Graph Type</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once you get an @RISK graph such as the one in Figure 15.30, you can display it in several ways by clicking the fourth button’s dropdown arrow at the bottom of the graph window. In particular, if your graph doesn’t look quite like the ones shown here, try changing from Discrete Probability to Probability Density.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Percentiles Displayed on Graphs</p>
 <p class="blog">
The graph in Figure 15.35 has the right slider on 500 and shows 5% to the right of it. By default, @RISK puts the sliders at the 5th and 95th percentiles, so that 5% is on either side of them. For this example, 500 is indeed the 95th percentile (why?), but the picture is a bit misleading because there is no chance of a profit greater than 500. If you manually move the right slider away from 500 and back again, it will correctly indicate that there is no probability to the right of 500.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Saving Graphs and Tables</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you run a simulation with @RISK and then save your file, it asks whether you want to save your graphs and tables. We suggest that you save them. This makes your file slightly larger, but when you reopen it, the temporary graphs and tables, such as the histogram in Figure 15.30, are still available. Otherwise, you will have to rerun the simulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can click the Summary button (see Figure 15.29) to see the window in Figure 15.31 with the summary measures for Profit. In general, this report shows the summary for all designated inputs and outputs. By default, this Results Summary window shows a mini graph for each output and a number of numerical summary measures. It is also easy to customize. If you right-click anywhere on this table and choose Columns for Table, you can check or uncheck various options. For most of the later screenshots in this book, we elected not to show the Error column, but instead to show the standard deviation column.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For a quick (and customizable) report of the results, click @RISK’s Summary button.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can click the Excel Reports button (see Figure 15.29) to choose from a number of reports that are placed on new worksheets. This is a good option if you want permanent (but non-interactive) copies of reports in your workbook. As an example, Figure 15.32 shows part of the Quick Reports option you can request. It has the same information as the summary report in Figure 15.31, plus more.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you want permanent copies of the simulation results, click on @RISK’s Excel Reports buttons and check the reports you want. They will be placed in new worksheets.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The strength of @RISK is that it keeps track of any outputs you designate and then allows you to show the corresponding results as graphs or tables, in temporary windows or in permanent worksheets. As you have seen, @RISK provides several options for displaying results, and we encourage you to explore the possibilities. However, don’t lose sight of the overall goal: to see how outputs vary as random inputs vary, and to generate reports that tell the story most effectively. For this particular example, the results in Figures 15.27, 15.30, 15.31, and 15.32 allow you to conclude the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The smallest simulated profit (out of 1000) was -$242.50, the largest was $500, the average was $337.51, and the standard deviation of the 1000 profits was $189.06. Of all simulated profits, 5% were -$47.50 or below, 95% were $500 or above, 36% were less than or equal to $300, and 51.5% were larger than $400. (See Figure 15.27. These results are also available from the summary table in Figure 15.31 or the quick report in Figure 15.32.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The profit distribution for this order quantity is extremely skewed to the left, with a large bar at $500. (See Figure 15.30.) Do you see why? It is because profit is exactly $500 if demand is greater than or equal to the order quantity, 200. In other words, the probability that profit is $500 equals the probability that demand is at least 200. (This probability is 0.4.) Lower demands result in decreasing profits, which explains the gradual decline in the histogram from right to left.</p>

<strong>Using RiskSimtable</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Walton’s ultimate goal is to choose an order quantity that provides a large average profit. You could rerun the simulation model several times, each time with a different order quantity in the order quantity cell, and compare the results. However, this has two drawbacks. First, it takes a lot of time and work. The second drawback is more subtle. Each time you run the simulation, you get a different set of random demands. Therefore, one of the order quantities could win the contest just by luck. For a fairer comparison, it is better to test each order quantity on the same set of random demands.</p>

The RiskSimtable function in @RISK enables you to obtain a fair comparison quickly and easily. This function is illustrated in Figure 15.33. (See the file Ordering Calendars -RiskSimtable Finished.xlsx.) There are two modifications to the previous model. First, the order quantities to test are listed in row 9. (We chose these as representative order quantities. You could change, or add to, this list.) Second, instead of entering a number in cell B9, you enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
The RiskSimtable function allows you to run several simulations at once—one for each value of some variable (often a decision variable).</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable(D9:H9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the list does not need to be entered in the spreadsheet (although it is a good idea to do so). You could instead enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable({150,175,200,225,250})</p>
 <p class="blog">
where the list of numbers must be enclosed in curly brackets. In either case, the worksheet displays the first member of the list, 150, and the corresponding calculations for this first order quantity. However, the model is now set up to run the simulation for all order quantities in the list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To implement this, only one setting needs to be changed. As before, enter 1000 for the number of iterations, but also enter 5 for the number of simulations. @RISK then runs five simulations of 1000 iterations each, one simulation for each order quantity in the list, and it uses the same 1000 random demands for each simulation. This provides a fair comparison.</p>

<strong>@RISK Function</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
RiskSimtable</p>
 <p class="blog">
To run several simulations all at once, enter the formula =RiskSimtable(Inputs) in any cell. Here, Inputs refers to a list of the values to be simulated, such as various order quantities. This can be a range reference or a list of values in curly brackets. Before running the simulation, make sure the number of simulations is set to the number of values in the Inputs list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can again get results from the simulation in various ways. Here are some possibilities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can enter the same @RISK statistical functions in cells in the model work sheet, as shown in rows 18–23 of Figure 15.33. The trick is to realize that each such function has an optional last argument that specifies the simulation number. For example, the formulas in cells C20 and C22 are</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMean($F$13,C16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskPercentile($F$13,0.05,C16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Remember that the results in these cells are meaningless (or show up as errors) until you run the simulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can select the profit cell and click the Browse Results button to see a histogram of profits, as shown in Figure 15.34. By default, the histogram shown is for the first simulation, where the order quantity is 150. However, if you click the red histogram button with the pound sign, you can select any of the simulations. As an example, Figure 15.35 shows the histogram of profits for simulation 5, where the order quantity is 250. (Do you see why these two histograms are so different? When the order quantity is 150, there is a high probability of selling out, so the spike on the right is large. But the probability of selling out with an order quantity of 250 is much lower, so its spike at the right is much less dominant.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can click the Summary button to get the results from all simulations shown in Figure 15.36. (These results match those in Figure 15.33.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You can click the Excel Reports button to get any of several reports on permanent worksheets. Again, Quick Reports is a good choice. This produces several graphs and summary measures for each simulation, each on a different worksheet. This provides a lot of information with almost no work.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For this example, the results in Figures 15.33–15.36 are illuminating. You can see that an order quantity of 175 provides the largest mean profit. However, is this necessarily the “best” order quantity? This depends on the company’s attitude toward risk. Larger order quantities incur more risk (their histograms are more spread out, their 5th and 95th percentiles are more extreme), but they also have more upside potential. On the other hand, a smaller order quantity, while having a somewhat smaller mean, might be preferable because of less variability. It is not an easy choice, but at least the simulation results provide plenty of information for making the decision.</p>
