            <p class="blog"><strong>SALES VERSUS PROMOTIONS AT PHARMEX </strong></p> <p class="blog">Pharmex is a chain of drugstores that operates around the country. To see how effective its advertising and other promotional activities are, the company has collected data from 50 randomly selected metropolitan regions. In each region it has compared its own promotional expenditures and sales to those of the leading competitor in the region over the past year. There are two variables:</p> <p class="blog">• Promote: Pharmex’s promotional expenditures as a percentage of those of the leading competitor</p> <p class="blog">• Sales: Pharmex’s sales as a percentage of those of the leading competitor</p> <p class="blog">Note that each of these variables is an index, not a dollar amount. For example, if Promote equals 95 for some region, this indicates that Pharmex’s promotional expenditures in that region are 95% as large as those for the leading competitor in that region. The company expects that there is a positive relationship between these two variables, so that regions with relatively larger expenditures have relatively larger sales. However, it is not clear what the nature of this relationship is. The data are listed in the file Drugstore Sales.xlsx. (See Figure 10.1 for a listing of the data, with several rows hidden.) What type of relationship, if any, is apparent from a scatterplot?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use a scatterplot to examine the relationship between promotional expenses and sales at Pharmex.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/10.1-768x221.png"></div>

It is customary to put the explanatory variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. In this example the store believes large promotional expenditures tend to “cause” larger values of sales, so Sales is on the vertical axis and Promote is on the horizontal axis. The resulting scatterplot appears in Figure 10.2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This scatterplot indicates that there is indeed a positive relationship between Promote and Sales—the points tend to rise from bottom left to top right—but the relationship is not perfect. If it were perfect, a given value of Promote would predict the value of Sales exactly. Clearly, this is not the case. For example, there are five regions with promotional values of 96 but all of them have different sales values. So the scatterplot indicates that while the variable Promote is helpful for predicting Sales, it does not lead to perfect predictions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, we briefly discuss causation. There is a tendency for an analyst (such as a drugstore manager) to say that larger promotional expenses cause larger sales values. However, unless the data are obtained in a carefully controlled experiment—which is certainly not the case here—you can never be absolutely sure about causation. One reason is that you can’t always be sure which direction the causation goes. Does X cause Y, or does Y cause X? Another reason is that you can almost never rule out the possibility that some other variable is causing the variation in both of the observed variables. Although this is unlikely in this drugstore example, it is still a possibility.</p>
