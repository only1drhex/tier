Hamilton now requests a $7 million credit line, and you must draft your first credit opinion for a senior credit analyst. Unfortunately, Hamilton just changed management, and its financial report for the last six months was not only late but also garbled. As best as you can tell, its sales, assets, operating expenses, and liabilities for the six month period concluded display the following patterns:</p>

Hamilton has a 16-year relationship with the bank and has routinely received and paid off a credit line of $4 million to $5 million. The department’s senior analyst tells you to prepare because you will be asked for your opinion of this loan request (though you have been led to believe the loan will be approved anyway, because Hamilton’s president serves on Evergreen’s board of directors).</p>

What will you recommend if asked? Is there any reason to question the latest data supplied by this customer? If this loan request is granted, what do you think the customer will do with the funds?</p>

The figures given in the case as well as the supporting background information suggest several developing problems. Hamilton has had a recent shakeup in its senior management, which usually leads to loss in control of the firm until the new management gains sufficient experience. Among the obvious problems are declines in sales (from $48.1 million to $39.7 million) in the past six months. Hamilton&#8217;s cost of goods sold dropped but by less than the decline in sales, thereby squeezing the firm&#8217;s margin and net income. We also noted that the firm, faced with declining cash flows, has been forced to rely more heavily on borrowings which will mean that the bank&#8217;s position will be less secure. Current assets have also declined while current liabilities are on the rise, thus reducing the firm&#8217;s net liquidity position. The bank&#8217;s relationship with Hamilton needs to be reviewed carefully with an eye to gaining additional collateral or reducing the bank&#8217;s total credit commitment to the firm.</p>

Additional information that would be desirable and helpful, if not essential, should include:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Past financial statements for the last two or three years, preferably on a monthly basis. This could help us verify seasonality and improvement.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Industry outlook for the next six to eighteen months would also help in reinforcing Hamilton&#8217;s ability to service the debt from the summer and fall cash flows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Additionally, information about the company&#8217;s suppliers, other creditors, customers, and competitors would be helpful.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Also, more information about other relationships that Hamilton has with Evergreen would certainly be helpful.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
In summary, the more information we have, the better our analysis and subsequent decisions will be.</p>
