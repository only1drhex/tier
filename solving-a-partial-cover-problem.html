A telecommunications company must decide where to locate cell phone towers. The budget allows no more than three to be installed in a particular city. The city has been divided into 10 zones; eight potential sites have been identified for the cell phone towers. A survey has been conducted to estimate how many cell phone customers will need to be served within each zone. It is desired to locate the cell phone towers so the largest number of customers are covered. The <span class="tex-text">\(a_{ij}\)</span> cover coefficients (expressed in thousands of customers) reflect the maximum number of potential cell phone customers in zone i. Since the number of customers is independent of where the cell phone towers are located, the cover coefficients are identical for all values of j that provide coverage for a given zone.<br /> From Figure 10.23, in anticipation of a SOLVER solution, cell J13 is set up to be the target cell. It consists of the sum of the maxima of the product of the decision variable and</p>
 <p class="blog">
the cover coefficient. The formula for an individual entry in column J and rows 3 through 13 is also shown at the bottom of Figure 10.23.<br /> Applying SOLVER with a limit of, at most, three cell phone towers, the SOLVER solution obtained is for <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = x_{4} = x_{7} = 1, \)</span> and all other decision variables equal 0. With cell phone towers located at sites 2, 4, and 7, a total coverage of 320,000 out of a maximum of 360,000 customers will occur. Unfortunately, that is not the optimum solution. If cell phone towers are placed at sites 2, 3, and 4 or 2, 4, and 8, then a coverage of 335,000 customers will occur.<br /> With a variety of starting points for the SOLVER search, solutions of <span class="tex-text">\( x_{2} = x_{4} = x_{7} = 1 \)</span> occur.<br /> Since SOLVER did not perform well for this example, what else might be used to solve the partial cover problem? We applied a “greedy algorithm” to obtain the optimum solutions: <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = x_{3} = x_{4} = 1 \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = x_{4} = x_{8} = 1. \)</span> Figure 10.24 illustrates the steps taken in applying the greedy algorithm:<br /> 1. Sum the cover coefficients in each column.<br /> 2. Select the site covering the most customers. (In this case, site 2 is chosen because it covers 125,000 customers.)<br /> 3. Eliminate rows in the cover matrix that were covered by site 2.<br /> 4. Sum the remaining cover coefficients in each column.<br /> 5. Select the site covering the most customers. (In this case, site 4 is chosen because it covers 120,000 customers.)<br /> 6. Eliminate rows in the cover matrix that were covered by site 4.<br /> 7. Sum the remaining cover coefficients in each column.<br /> 8. Select the site covering the most customers. (In this case, sites 3 and 8 tie; each covers the same 90,000 customers in zones 3, 4, and 5.)<br /> 9. Since the maximum allowable number of cell phone towers (3) have been assigned to sites, the search ends with the following solutions: <span class="tex-text">\( x_{2} = x_{4} = x_{3} = 1 \)</span>and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = x_{4} = x_{8} = 1 \)</span><br /> Notice, if a single cell phone tower is to be installed, it should be installed at site 2 and achieve a coverage of 125,000 customers. If two cell phone towers are installed, the</p>
 <p class="blog">
second one should be located at site 4 to cover an additional 120,000 customers. If four cell phone towers can be installed, then the fourth one should be located at either site 1 or site 7 to cover the remaining 25,000 customers in zone 2.<br /> (Our experience with using SOLVER to solve binary linear programming problems has been mixed. Given a choice, mathematical programming software should be used to solve such problems. However, since we cannot assume that students taking a course in which this text is used have access to mathematical programming software, we will continue to use SOLVER to obtain, hopefully, good approximations of optimum solutions.)<br /> The greedy algorithm used to solve  is a simpler version<br /> of a heuristic algorithm developed by Shannon and Ignizio [63] and applied to a minimization version of the partial cover problem. To illustrate its use, we will solve the example found in [63]. Before doing so, we note that the greedy algorithm used to solve the partial cover problem can also be used to solve the total cover problem.</p>
