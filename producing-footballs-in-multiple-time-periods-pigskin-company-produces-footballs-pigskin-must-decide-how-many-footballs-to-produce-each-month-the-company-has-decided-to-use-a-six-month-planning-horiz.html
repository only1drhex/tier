            <p class="blog"><strong>PRODUCING FOOTBALLS IN MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS </strong></p> <p class="blog">Pigskin Company produces footballs. Pigskin must decide how many footballs to produce each month. The company has decided to use a six-month planning horizon. The forecasted monthly demands for the next six months are 10,000, 15,000, 30,000, 35,000, 25,000, and 10,000. Pigskin wants to meet these demands on time, knowing that it currently has 5000 footballs in inventory and that it can use a given month’s production to help meet the demand for that month. (For simplicity, we assume that production occurs during the month, and demand occurs at the end of the month.) During each month there is enough production capacity to produce up to 30,000 footballs, and there is enough storage capacity to store up to 10,000 footballs at the end of the month, after demand has occurred. The forecasted production costs per football for the next six months are $12.50, $12.55, $12.70, $12.80, $12.85, and $12.95, respectively. The holding cost per football held in inventory at the end of any month is figured at 5% of the production cost for that month. (This cost includes the cost of storage and also the cost of money tied up in inventory.) The selling price for footballs is not considered relevant to the production decision because Pigskin will satisfy all customer demand exactly when it occurs—at whatever the selling price is. In other words, total revenue for the planning horizon is fixed, regardless of production decisions. Therefore, Pigskin wants to determine the production schedule that minimizes the total production and holding costs.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use LP to find the production schedule that meets demand on time and minimizes total production and inventory holding costs.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The input values for this problem are not all easy to find. Here are some thoughts on where they might be obtained.</p> <p class="blog">• The initial inventory should be available from the company’s database system or from a physical count.</p> <p class="blog">• The unit production costs would probably be estimated in two steps. First, the company might ask its cost accountants to estimate the current unit production cost. Then it could examine historical trends in costs to estimate inflation factors for future months.</p> <p class="blog">• The holding cost percentage is typically difficult to determine. Depending on the type of inventory being held, this cost can include storage and handling, rent, property taxes, insurance, spoilage, and obsolescence. It can also include capital costs—the cost of money that could be used for other purposes.</p> <p class="blog">• The demands are probably forecasts made by the marketing and sales department. They might be “seat-of-the-pants” forecasts, or they might be the result of a formal quantitative forecasting procedure as discussed in Chapter 12. Of course, if there are already some orders on the books for future months, these are included in the demand figures.</p> <p class="blog">• The production and storage capacities are probably supplied by the production department. They are based on the size of the workforce, the available machinery, availability of raw materials, and physical space.</p>

The variables for this model appear in Figure 13.27. There are two keys to relating these variables. First, the months cannot be treated independently. This is because the ending inventory in one month is the beginning inventory for the next month. Second, to ensure that demand is satisfied on time, the amount on hand after production in each month must be at least as large as the demand for that month. This constraint must be included explicitly in the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you model this type of problem, you must be very specific about the timing of events. Depending on the assumptions you make, there can be a variety of potential models. For example, when does the demand for footballs in a given month occur: at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, or continually throughout the month? The same question can be asked about production in a given month. The answers to these two questions indicate how much of the production in a given month can be used to help satisfy the demand in that month. Also, are the maximum storage constraint and the holding cost based on the ending inventory in a month, the average amount of inventory in a month, or the maximum inventory in a month? Each of these possibilities is reasonable and could be implemented.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To simplify the model, we assume that (1) all production occurs at the beginning of the month, (2) all demand occurs after production, so that all units produced in a month can be used to satisfy that month’s demand, and (3) the storage constraint and the holding cost are based on ending inventory in any month. (You are asked to modify these assumptions in the problems.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
By modifying the timing assumptions in this type of model, alternative—and equally realistic—models with very different solutions can be obtained.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Algebraic Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In the traditional algebraic model, the decision variables are the production quantities for the six months, labeled <span class="tex-text">\(P_{1}\)</span> through <span class="tex-text">\(P_{6}\)</span>. It is also convenient to let <span class="tex-text">\(I_{1} \text { through } I_{6}\)</span> be the corresponding end-of-month inventories (after demand has occurred).<span class="tex-text">\(^{12}\)</span> For example, <span class="tex-text">\(I_{3}\)</span> is the number of footballs left over at the end of month 3. Therefore, the obvious constraints are on production and inventory storage capacities: <span class="tex-text">\(P_{j} \leq 30000 \text { and } I_{j} \leq 10000 \text { for } 1 \leq j \leq 6\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In addition to these constraints, balance constraints that relate the P’s and I’s are necessary. In any month the inventory from the previous month plus the current production equals the current demand plus leftover inventory. If <span class="tex-text">\(D_{j}\)</span> is the forecasted demand for month j, the balance equation for month j is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(I_{j-1}+P_{j}=D_{j}+I_{j}\)</span> <p class="blog">
The balance equation for month 1 uses the known beginning inventory, 5000, for the previous inventory (the <span class="tex-text">\(I_{j-1}\)</span> term). By putting all variables (P’s and I’s) on the left and all known values on the right (a standard LP convention), these balance constraints can be written as</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}&amp;P_{1}-I_{1}=1000-5000 \\&amp;I_{1}+P_{2}-I_{2}=15000 \\&amp;I_{2}+P_{3}-I_{3}=30000 \\&amp;I_{3}+P_{4}-I_{4}=35000 \\&amp;I_{4}+P_{5}-I_{5}=25000 \\&amp;I_{5}+P_{6}-I_{6}=10000\end{aligned}\)</span> (13.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
As usual, there are nonnegativity constraints: all P’s and I’s must be nonnegative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What about meeting demand on time? This requires that in each month the inventory from the preceding month plus the current production must be at least as large as the current demand. But take a look, for example, at the balance equation for month 3. By rearranging it slightly, it becomes</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(I_{3}=I_{2}+P_{3}-30000\)</span> <p class="blog">
Now, the nonnegativity constraint on <span class="tex-text">\(I_{3}\)</span> implies that the right side of this equation, <span class="tex-text">\(I_{2}+P_{3}-30000\)</span>, must also be nonnegative. But this implies that demand in month 3 is covered—the beginning inventory in month 3 plus month 3 production is at least 30000. Therefore, the nonnegativity constraints on the I’s automatically guarantee that all demands will be met on time, and no other constraints are needed. Alternatively, the constraint can be written directly as <span class="tex-text">\(I_{2}+P_{3} \geq 30000\)</span>. In words, the amount on hand after production in month 3 must be at least as large as the demand in month 3. The spreadsheet model takes advantage of this interpretation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, the objective to minimize is the sum of production and holding costs. It is the sum of unit production costs multiplied by P’s, plus unit holding costs multiplied by I’s.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model of Pigskin’s production problem is shown in Figure 13.28. (See the file Production Scheduling Finished.xlsx.) The main feature that distinguishes this model from the product mix model is that some of the constraints, namely, Equations (13.1), are built into the spreadsheet itself by means of</p>
 <p class="blog">
12 This example illustrates a subtle difference between algebraic and spreadsheet models. It is often convenient in algebraic models to define “decision variables,” in this case the I’s, that are really determined by other decision variables, in this case the P’s. In spreadsheet models, however, we typically define the decision variable cells as the smallest set of variables that must be chosen—in this case the production quantities. Then values that are determined by these decision variable cells, such as the ending inventory levels, can be calculated with spreadsheet formulas.</p>
 <p class="blog">
formulas. This means that the only decision variable cells are the production quantities. The ending inventories shown in row 20 are determined by the production quantities and Equations (13.1). As you see, the decision variables in an algebraic model (the P’s and I’s) are not necessarily the same as the decision variable cells in an equivalent spreadsheet model. (The only decision variable cells in the spreadsheet model correspond to the P’s.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
To develop the spreadsheet model in Figure 13.28, proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the blue cells. Again, these are all entered as numbers directly from the problem statement. (Unlike some spreadsheet modelers who prefer to put all inputs in the upper left corner of the spreadsheet, we enter the inputs wherever they fit most naturally. Of course, this takes some planning before diving in.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Name ranges. Name the ranges indicated. Note that all but one of these (Total_cost) can be named easily with the range-naming shortcut, using the labels in column A.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Production quantities. Enter any values in the range Units_produced as production quantities. As always, you can enter values that you believe are good, maybe even optimal. This is not crucial, however, because Solver eventually finds the optimal production quantities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. On-hand inventory. Enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B4+B12</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B16. This calculates the first month’s on-hand inventory after production (but before demand). Then enter the typical formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B20+C12</p>
 <p class="blog">
for on-hand inventory after production in month 2 in cell C16 and copy it across row 16.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Ending inventories. Enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B16-B18</p>
 <p class="blog">
In multiperiod problems, there is often one formula for the first period and a slightly different (copyable) formula for all other periods.</p>
 <p class="blog">
for ending inventory in cell B20 and copy it across row 20. This formula calculates ending inventory in the current month as on-hand inventory before demand minus the demand in that month.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Production and holding costs. Enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B8*B12</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B26 and copy it across to cell G26 to calculate the monthly production costs. Then enter the formu</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$5*B8*B20</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B27 and copy it across to cell G27 to calculate the monthly holding costs. Note that these are based on monthly ending inventories. Finally, calculate the cost totals in column H with the SUM function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
To use Solver, fill out the main dialog box as shown in Figure 13.29. The logic behind the constraints is straightforward. The constraints are that (1) the production quantities cannot exceed the production capacities, (2) the on-hand inventories after production must be at least as large as the demands, and (3) the ending inventories cannot exceed the storage capacities. Check the Non-Negative option and select the Simplex LP method, and then click Solve.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution from Solver appears in Figure 13.30. The solution can be interpreted best by comparing production quantities to demands. In month 1, Pigskin should produce just enough to meet month 1 demand (taking into account the initial inventory of 5000). In month 2, it should produce 5000 more footballs than month 2 demand, and then in month 3 it should produce just enough to meet month 3 demand, while still carrying the extra 5000 footballs in inventory from month 2 production. In month 4, Pigskin should finally use these 5000 footballs, along with the maximum production amount, 30,000, to meet month 4 demand. Then in months 5 and 6 it should produce exactly enough to meet these months’ demands. The total cost is $1,535,563, most of which is production cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Could you have guessed this optimal solution? Upon reflection, it makes perfect sense. Because the monthly holding costs are large relative to the differences in monthly production costs, there is little incentive to produce footballs before they are needed to take advantage of a “cheap” production month. Therefore, Pigskin Company produces foot balls in the month when they are needed—when possible. The only exception to this rule is the 20,000 footballs produced during month 2 when only 15,000 are needed. The extra 5000 footballs produced in month 2 are needed, however, to meet the month 4 demand of 35,000, because month 3 production capacity is used entirely to meet the month 3 demand. Thus month 3 capacity is not available to meet the month 4 demand, and 5000 units of month 2 capacity are used to meet the month 4 demand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can often improve your intuition by trying to reason why Solver’s solution is indeed optimal.</p>

<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Multiperiod Optimization Problems and Myopic Solutions</p>
 <p class="blog">
Many optimization problems are of a multiperiod nature, where a sequence of decisions must be made over time. When making the first of these decisions, the one for this week or this month, say, it is usually best to include future decisions in the model, as has been done here. If you ignore future periods and make the initial decision based only on the first period, the resulting decision is called myopic (short-sighted). Myopic decisions are occasionally optimal, but not very often. The idea is that if you act now in a way that looks best in the short run, it might lead you down a strategically unattractive path for the long run.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
SolverTable can now be used to perform a number of interesting sensitivity analyses. We illustrate two possibilities. First, note that the most inventory ever carried at the end of a month is 5000, although the storage capacity each month is 10,000. Perhaps this is because the holding cost percentage, 5%, is fairly large. Would more ending inventory be carried if this holding cost percentage were lower? Or would even less be carried if it were higher? You can check this with the SolverTable output shown in Figure 13.31. Now the single input cell is cell B5, and the single output is the maximum ending inventory ever held, which you can calculate in cell B31 with the formula</p>

If you want Solver Table to keep track of a quantity that is not in your model, you need to create it with an appropriate formula in a new cell.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As the SolverTable results indicate, the storage capacity limit is reached only when the holding cost percentage falls to 1%. (This output doesn’t indicate which month or how many months the ending inventory is at the upper limit.) On the other hand, even when the holding cost percentage reaches 10%, the company still continues to hold a maximum ending inventory of 5000.</p>

A second possible sensitivity analysis is suggested by the way the optimal production schedule would probably be implemented. The optimal solution to Pigskin’s model specifies the production level for each of the next six months. In reality,</p>
 <p class="blog">
however, the company would probably implement the model’s recommendation only for the first month. Then at the beginning of the second month, it would gather new forecasts for the next six months, months 2 through 7, solve a new six-month model, and again implement the model’s recommendation for the first of these months, month 2. If the company continues in this manner, we say that it is following a six-month rolling planning horizon.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The question, then, is whether the assumed demands (really, forecasts) toward the end of the planning horizon have much effect on the optimal production quantity in month 1. We would hope not, because these forecasts could be quite inaccurate. The two-way Solver table in Figure 13.32 shows how the optimal month 1 production quantity varies with the forecasted demands in months 5 and 6. As you can see, if the errors in the forecasted demands for months 5 and 6 remain fairly small, the optimal month 1 production quantity remains at 5000. This is good news. It means that the optimal production quantity in month 1 is fairly insensitive to the possibly inaccurate forecasts for months 5 and 6.</p>

Solver’s sensitivity report for this model appears in Figure 13.33. The bottom part of this report is fairly straightforward to interpret. The first six rows are for sensitivity to changes in the demand, whereas the last six are for sensitivity to changes in the storage capacity. (There are no rows for the production capacity constraints because these are simple upper-bound constraints on the decision variables. Recall that Solver’s sensitivity report handles this type of constraint differently from “normal” constraints.) In contrast, the top part of the report is virtually impossible to unravel. This is because the objective coefficients of the decision variables are each based on multiple inputs. (Each is a combination of unit production costs and the holding cost percentage.) Therefore, if you want to know how the solution will change if you change a single unit production cost or the holding cost percentage, this report does not answer your question. This is one case where a sensitivity analysis with SolverTable is much more straightforward and intuitive. It allows you to change any of the model’s inputs and directly see the effects on the solution.</p>

We assume that Pigskin uses a six-month planning horizon. Why six months? In multiperiod models such as this, the company has to make forecasts about the future, such as the level of customer demand. Therefore, the length of the planning horizon is usually the length of time for which the company can make reasonably accurate forecasts. Here, Pigskin evidently believes that it can forecast up to six months from now, so it uses a six-month planning horizon.</p>
