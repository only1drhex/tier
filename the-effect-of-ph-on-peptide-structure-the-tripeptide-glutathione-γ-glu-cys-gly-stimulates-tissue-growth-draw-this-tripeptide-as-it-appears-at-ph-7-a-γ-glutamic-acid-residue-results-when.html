            <p class="blog">The effect of pH on peptide structure<br /> The tripeptide glutathione, γ-Glu-Cys-Gly, stimulates tissue growth. Draw this tripeptide as it appears at pH 7. (A γ-glutamic acid residue results when glutamic acid forms a peptide bond using the carboxyl group of its side chain, rather than the carboxyl group attached to its α carbon atom.)<br /> Strategy<br /> Begin by drawing the tripeptide without worrying about charges. The structure of the amino group at the N-terminus and that of the carboxyl group at the C-terminus will vary with pH, as will the side chains of any polar-acidic or polar-basic amino acids.
