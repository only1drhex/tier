            <p class="blog">The twin paradox, discussed earlier, is a classic “paradox” in relativity. Another classic “paradox” is this: Suppose a runner moving at 0.75c carries a horizontal pole 15 m long toward a barn that is 10 m long. The barn has front and rear doors. An observer on the ground can instantly and simultaneously open and close the two doors by remote control. When the runner and the pole are inside the barn, the ground observer closes and then opens both doors so that the runner and pole are momentarily captured inside the barn and then proceed to exit the barn from the back door. Do both the runner and the ground observer agree that the runner makes it safely through the barn?</p>

From our everyday experience, we would be surprised to see a 15-m pole fit inside a 10-m barn. But the pole is in motion with respect to the ground observer, who measures the pole to be contracted to a length <span class="tex-text">\( L_{\text {pole }} \)</span>, where</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( L_{ pole }=L_{p} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}=(15 m ) \sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}=9.9 m \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus, the ground observer measures the pole to be slightly shorter than the barn and there is no problem with momentarily capturing the pole inside it. The “paradox” arises when we consider the runner’s point of view. The runner sees the barn contracted to</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( L_{\text {barn }}=L_{p} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}=(10 m ) \sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}=6.6 m \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the pole is in the rest frame of the runner, the runner measures it to have its proper length of 15 m. How can a 15-m pole fit inside a 6.6-m barn? While this is the classic question that is often asked, this is not the question we have asked, because it is not the important question. We asked if the runner can make it safely through the barn.<br /> The resolution of the “paradox” lies in the relativity of simultaneity. The closing of the two doors is measured to be simultaneous by the ground observer. Because the doors are at different positions, however, they do not close simultaneously as measured by the runner. The rear door closes and then opens first, allowing the leading edge of the pole to exit. The front door of the barn does not close until the trailing edge of the pole passes by.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We can analyze this using a space-time graph. Figure 39.13a is a space–time graph from the ground observer’s point of view. We choose x = 0 as the position of the front door of the barn and t = 0 as the instant at which the leading end of the pole is located at the front door of the barn. The world-lines for the two ends of the barn are separated by 10 m and are vertical because the barn is not moving relative to this observer. For the pole, we follow two tilted world-lines, one for each end of the moving pole. These world-lines are 9.9 m apart horizontally, which is the contracted length seen by the ground observer. As seen in Figure 39.13a, at one instant, the pole is entirely within the barn.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 39.13b shows the space–time graph according to the runner. Here, the world-lines for the pole are separated by 15 m and are vertical because the pole is at rest in the runner’s frame of reference. The barn is hurtling toward the runner, so the world-lines for the front and rear doors of the barn are tilted in the opposite direction compared to Figure 39.13a.<br /> The world-lines for the barn are separated by 6.6 m, the contracted length as seen by the runner. Notice that the front of the pole leaves the rear door of the barn long before the back of the pole enters the barn. Thus, the opening of the rear door occurs before the closing of the front door.<br /> From the ground observer’s point of view, the time at which the trailing end of the pole enters the barn is found from</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \Delta t=t-0=t=\frac{\Delta x}{v}=\frac{9.9 m }{0.75 c}=\frac{13.2 m }{c} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus, the pole should be completely inside the barn at a time corresponding to ct = 13.2 m. This is consistent with the point on the ct axis in Figure 39.13a where the pole is inside the barn.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the runner’s point of view, the time at which the leading end of the pole leaves the barn is found from</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \Delta t=t-0=t=\frac{\Delta x}{v}=\frac{6.6 m }{0.75 c}=\frac{8.8 m }{c} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
leading to ct = 8.8 m. This is consistent with the point on the ct axis in Figure 39.13b where the back door of the barn arrives at the leading end of the pole. Finally, the time at which the trailing end of the pole enters the front door of the barn is found from</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \Delta t=t-0=t=\frac{\Delta x}{v}=\frac{15 m }{0.75 c}=\frac{20 m }{c} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This gives ct = 20 m, which agrees with the instant shown in Figure 39.13b.</p>
