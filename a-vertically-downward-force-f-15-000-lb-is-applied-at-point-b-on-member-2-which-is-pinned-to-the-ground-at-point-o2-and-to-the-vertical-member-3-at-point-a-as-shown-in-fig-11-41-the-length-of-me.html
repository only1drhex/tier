            <p class="blog">A vertically downward force <em>F</em> = 15 000 lb is applied at point <em>B</em> on member 2, which is pinned to the ground at point <em>O<sub>2</sub></em> and to the vertical member 3 at point <em>A</em>, as shown in Fig. 11.41. The length of member 2, that is <span class="tex-text">\(R_{B O_{2}}\)</span> , is 60 in, and the ground pin <em>O<sub>3</sub></em> is located at a distance <em>b</em> = 30 in along the <em>x</em> axis from the ground pin <em>O<sub>2 </sub></em>. Members 2 and 3 are made from a steel alloy with a compressive yield strength <em>S<sub>yc</sub></em> = 60 kpsi and a modulus of elasticity <em>E</em> = 30 Mpsi. For buckling in the plane, member 3 behaves as a pinned-pinned member. Therefore, the theoretic end-condition constant is <em>C</em> = 1. For buckling out of the plane, member 3 behaves as a fixed-fixed member with a theoretic end-condition constant <em>C</em> = 4.</p> <p class="blog">Part A: Assuming that the slenderness ratio of member 3 is such that Euler’s column formula is valid, determine whether the following statements are true or false; give a brief explanation for each.</p> <p class="blog">1. For members with a slenderness ratio greater than 10, it is safe to assume that the members designed for failure against yielding are automatically safe against buckling failure.</p> <p class="blog">2. With all other design parameters unchanged, a member with fixed-free end conditions has a larger factor of safety guarding against buckling than the same member with pinned-pinned end conditions.</p> <p class="blog">3. Two members with the same length, cross section, and modulus of elasticity, but with different compressive yield strengths, have the same critical buckling load.</p> <p class="blog">Part B: Assume that member 3 has a hollow rectangular cross section as shown in Fig. 11.42a. Initially, it is not known whether member 3 will be attached to the ground at pin <em>O<sub>3</sub></em> as in either Case I or Case II shown in Fig. 11.42b. Using symbolic arguments (no numeric calculations are required), determine whether Case I or Case II leads to a higher factor of safety guarding against buckling. Assume the possibility of buckling failure in the plane of Fig. 11.41.</p> <p class="blog">Part C: Assuming the worst case scenario, that is, the case with the lower factor of safety guarding against buckling, design the cross section of member 3, that is, determine the dimension, <em>D</em>, such that member 3 has a factor of safety guarding against buckling failure of <em>N</em> = 2. Note that designing the cross section for the case with the lower factor of safety automatically ensures a safe design for the case with the higher factor of safety.</p> <p class="blog">Part D: Determine the factor of safety of member 3 guarding against buckling failure. Use the dimensions of the rectangular cross section obtained in Part C. Assume that member 3 is attached as in Case I and that there is the possibility of buckling out of the plane.</p> <p class="blog">Part E: Assume that member 3 is attached as shown in Case II and that there is the possibility of buckling in the plane. The problem is to determine a new value for <em>b</em>; that is, to change the location of pin <em>O<sub>3</sub></em>. Distance <em>b</em> cannot be less than 5 in and cannot be greater than 45 in. Using the dimensions of the rectangular cross section obtained in Part C, determine an expression for the factor of safety guarding against buckling failure as a function of distance <em>b</em>. Then, plot a graph of <em>N</em> versus <em>b</em>. Using this graph, determine the minimum value of <em>b</em> above which the member is safe against buckling failure.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-08-28-093949-26-768x469.jpg"></div><div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-111312-2-768x325.jpg"></div>

                <p class="blog">
Part A:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. For members with a slenderness ratio greater than 10, it is safe to assume that members designed for failure against yielding are automatically safe against buckling failure.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">FALSE.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. With all other design parameters unchanged, a member with fixed-free end conditions has a larger factor of safety than the same member with pinned-pinned end conditions.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">FALSE.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Two members with the same length, cross section, and modulus of elasticity but with different compressive yield strengths have the same value of critical buckling load.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">TRUE.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Part B:</p>
 <p class="blog">
For Case I, the second moment of area for member 3 can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(I_{\text {Case } I }=\frac{0.6 D(D)^{3}}{12}-\frac{0.4 D(0.8 D)^{3}}{12}=\frac{0.3952 D^{4}}{12}=0.03293 D^{4}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
For Case II, the second moment of area for member 3 can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(I_{\text {Case II }}=\frac{D(0.6 D)^{3}}{12}-\frac{0.8 D(0.4 D)^{3}}{12}=\frac{0.1648 D^{4}}{12}=0.01373 D^{4}\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the second moment of area of Case I is greater than the second moment of area of Case II; that is,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(I_{\text {Case I }}&gt;I_{\text {Case II }}\)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the cross-sectional area is the same in both cases, Eq. (2) implies that the radius of gyration of Case I is greater than the radius of gyration of Case II; that is,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(k_{\text {Case I }}&gt;k_{\text {Case II }}\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the length of the member is the same in both cases, Eq. (3) implies that the slenderness ratio in Case I is less than the slenderness ratio in Case II; that is,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\left(S_{ r }\right)_{\text {Case I }}&lt;\left(S_{ r }\right)_{\text {Case II }}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, for either Euler’s column formula or Johnson’s parabolic equation, the critical load of Case I is greater than the critical load of Case II, that is,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\left(P_{ cr }\right)_{\text {Case } I }&gt;\left(P_{ cr }\right)_{\text {Case II }}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the applied load is the same in both cases, the factor of safety guarding against buckling for Case I is greater than the factor of safety guarding against buckling for Case II, that is,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\((N)_{\text {Case I }}&gt;(N)_{\text {Case II }}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
This implies that, if the cross-sectional area of the member is designed for Case II, then the member will automatically be safe against buckling for Case I.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Part C:</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cross-sectional area of member 3, that is, a hollow rectangular cross section, can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A=D(0.6 D)-0.8 D(0.4 D)=0.28 D^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
From Eq. (1), the second moment of area for member 3 can be written as <em>I</em> = 0.013 73D<sup>4</sup>. The radius of gyration of member 3 can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(k=\sqrt{\frac{I}{A}}=\sqrt{\frac{0.01373 D^{4}}{0.28 D^{2}}}=0.2215 D\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <em>b</em> = 30 in, the length of member 3 is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(L=b \tan 30^{\circ}=17.321 in\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the slenderness ratio of the member is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( S_{ r }=\frac{L}{k}=\frac{17.321 in }{0.2215 D}=\frac{78.199 in }{D}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The slenderness ratio at the point of tangency can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\left(S_{ r }\right)_{D}=\pi \sqrt{\frac{2 C E}{S_{y c}}}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
From the specified fixed-fixed end conditions, the end-condition constant is <em>C</em> = 1. Therefore, the slenderness ratio at the point of tangency is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\left(S_{ r }\right)_{D}=\pi \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 1\left(30 \times 10^{6} psi \right)}{60 \times 10^{3} psi }}=99.3\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
To determine the applied force at point <em>A</em>, we take moments about point <em>O<sub>2</sub></em>, which can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\((60 \text { in }) \cos 30^{\circ} F=b P_{\text {app }}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the applied force at point <em>A</em> is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{ app }=\frac{(60 in ) \cos 30^{\circ}(15000 lb )}{30 in }=25981 lb\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The factor of safety guarding against buckling is defined as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(N=\frac{P_{ cr }}{P_{ app }}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <em>N</em> = 2, the critical load is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{ cr }=P_{ app } N=(25981 lb ) 2=51962 lb\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note: At this point, it is not known whether Euler’s column formula or Johnson’s parabolic equation is the proper equation to determine the dimensions of the cross section of the member. If we assume that Johnson’s parabolic equation is the proper equation, then the critical load is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{ cr }=A\left[S_{y c}-\frac{1}{C E}\left(\frac{S_{y c} S_{ r }}{2 \pi}\right)^{2}\right]\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting the known values into this equation gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}51962 lb =&amp; 0.28 D^{2}\left[\left(60 \times 10^{3} psi \right)\right.\\&amp;\left.-\frac{1}{1\left(30 \times 10^{6} psi \right)}\left(\frac{\left(60 \times 10^{3} psi \right) 78.199}{2 \pi D}\right)^{2}\right]\end{aligned}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Rearranging this equation gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\((16800 psi ) D^{2}=51962 lb +5204 lb =57166 lb\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving this equation, dimension <em>D</em> is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><em>D</em> = 1.845 in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As a check, using Eq. (4) the slenderness ratio is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(S_{ r }=\frac{L}{k}=\frac{17.321 in }{0.2215(1.845 in )}=42.384&lt;\left(S_{ r }\right)_{D}=99.3\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, Johnson’s parabolic equation is proper for this case.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Part D:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the dimensions of the rectangular cross section are now known, the cross-sectional area of member 3 can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A=0.28 D^{2}=0.9531 in ^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
From Eq. (1), the moment of inertia of the hollow rectangular member can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(I=0.01373 D^{4}=0.1591 in ^{4}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
From Eq. (4), the radius of gyration for the member can be written as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><em>k</em> = 0.221 <em>5D</em> = 0.408 7 in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <em>b</em> = 30 in, the length of the member is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><em>L</em> = <em>b</em> tan 30° = 17.310 in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The slenderness ratio of the member is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(S_{ r }=\frac{L}{k}=\frac{17.310 in }{0.4087 in }=42.354\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the member is attached as shown in Case I, and there is the possibility of buckling out of the plane of Fig. 11.42, the end-condition constant is <em>C</em> = 4.

Part E:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Let distance <em>b</em> between pins <em>O<sub>2</sub></em> and <em>O<sub>3</sub></em> be varied between 5 in and 45 in. The goal is to determine the minimum value of <em>b</em> such that the member does not fail in buckling. Assume that member 3 is located at an unknown distance <em>b</em> from the pin <em>O<sub>2 </sub></em>. Then, force <em>P<sub>app</sub></em> acting at point <em>A</em> can be obtained by taking moments about <em>O<sub>2 </sub></em>, that is,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{ app }=\frac{\left(60 in \cos 30^{\circ}\right) 15000 lb }{b}=\frac{779420 in \cdot lb }{b}\)</span> (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
As in Part D, the cross-sectional area of member 3 is <em>A</em> = 0.953 1 in<sup>2</sup>, the moment of inertia is <em>I</em> = 0.159 1 in<sup>4</sup>, and the radius of gyration of the member is <em>k</em> = 0.408 7 in.</p>

The length of the member is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(L=b \tan 30^{\circ}=0.5774 b\)</span></p>

The slenderness ratio of the member is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(S_{ r }=\frac{L}{k}=\frac{0.5774 b}{0.4087 in }=\left(1.413 in ^{-1}\right) b\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note: Since <em>b</em> can vary between 5 in and 45 in, the maximum value of the slenderness ratio of the member is <em>S<sub>r</sub></em> = 63.58, which is still less than <span class="tex-text">\(\left(S_{ r }\right)_{D}=99.3.\)</span> This implies that Johnson’s parabolic equation is valid for all possible values of <em>b</em>. Therefore, the critical load can be written as</p>

Substituting the known data into this equation, the critical load can be written as</p>

The member will fail in buckling for all values of <em>b</em> for which the value of <em>N</em> is less than 1. A plot of <em>N</em> versus <em>b</em> is shown in Fig. 11.43. We observe from this plot that the factor of safety guarding against buckling is less than 1 for values of <em>b</em> less than 13.9 in. This implies failure in the buckling mode.</p>
