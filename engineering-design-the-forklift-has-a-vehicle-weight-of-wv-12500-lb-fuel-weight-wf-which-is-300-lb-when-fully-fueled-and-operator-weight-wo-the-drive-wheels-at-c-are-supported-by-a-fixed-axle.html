<strong>Road Map</strong> The following needs must be satisfied by the capacity rating we determine:</p>
 <ul> <li>The capacity rating should be as large as possible while still being safe.</li> <li>The forklift should not tip forward while supporting a load, regardless of whether the operator is on or off the vehicle.</li> <li>The rear tires should support enough force so they are capable of steering the forklift. This requirement applies when the forklift is being driven, and thus the operator may be assumed to be seated on the forklift.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
All our analyses will take the fuel weight to be zero, as the forklift is likely to see occasional use when its fuel supply is low, and this leads to a more conservative capacity rating. While somewhat arbitrary, but reasonable, we will assume the steering requirement is satisfied if the forces supported by the wheels at D are at least 10% of the forces supported by the wheels at C. When we analyze this requirement, an operator’s weight may be included. To obtain a conservative capacity rating, we must use the minimum possible operator weight, and this is difficult to determine with any precision. Obviously, this weight is small compared to the forklift’s weight, and it is conservative to take it as zero. If this is the case, then the no tipping requirement will automatically be satisfied if the steering requirement is met.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling</strong> The FBD is shown in Fig. 2 where we have imposed the constraint <span class="tex-text">\(D_{y} = \left(0\cdot 1\right) C_{y} \)</span> to enforce the need for steering ability, and the fuel and operator weights are zero. Clearly, as distance d from the load to the fork face increases (d is called the load center), the value of P that can be lifted decreases. The most conservative idea is to place P at the worst possible position, which is at d = 48 in. However, a quick investigation of industry practice shows that for purposes of specifying capacity rating, manufacturers customarily position P at the midpoint of the forks, which is d = 24 in.. In the following calculation we will consider both values of d, although the “official” capacity rating will be based on d = 24 in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Governing Equations</strong> Using the FBD in Fig. 2, the equilibrium equations are</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_{C} } =0: P\left(d + 13 in.\right)- \left(12,500 lb\right) \left(58 in.\right) + \left(0\cdot 1\right)C_{y} \left(64 in.\right) = 0\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_{y} } =0: C_{y} + \left(0\cdot 1\right)C_{y} &#8211; P &#8211; 12,500 lb =0\)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Computation</strong> Solving Eqs. (1) and (2) for P provides</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(P =12,500 lb\frac{58in. &#8211; \left(\frac{0\cdot 1}{1\cdot 1} \right) 64 in.}{d + 13 in. + \left(\frac{0\cdot 1}{1\cdot 1} \right)64 in. }\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion &amp; Verification</strong> When d = 24 in., we obtain P = 15,230 lb from Eq. (3), which we will round down slightly to obtain the capacity rating for the forklift as</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 80px"><strong>Capacity rating</strong> = 15,000 lb</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 80px">(load positioned 24 in. from the fork face). (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Remarks</strong></p>
 <ul> <li>The capacity rating in Eq. (4) will be used for advertising and marketing the forklift to customers. It will also be prominently displayed on the forklift, along with other important information, so that the operator is sure to see it and understand its meaning.</li> <li> If the forklift is used with d = 48 in., the load that can safely be lifted, as given by Eq. (3), reduces to 9762 lb. This number will be rounded down and will be displayed on the machine so that the operator knows that the maximum load that can safely be lifted is about 9000 lb when the load is positioned at 48 in. from the fork face.</li> <li>To complete our work, we will write a short report that details our assumptions calculations, and conclusions.</li> </ul> <div class="image-clearfix"> <img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2022/01/Capture63-1.png"></div>
