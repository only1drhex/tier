Known: A curved, solar absorber surface with a special coating is being cured by use of an infrared heater in a large room.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Find: Net rate of heat transfer to the absorber surface.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assumptions:<br /> 1. Steady-state conditions exist.<br /> 2. Convection effects are negligible.<br /> 3. Absorber and heater surfaces are diffuse and gray and are characterized by uniform irradiation and radiosity.<br /> 4. The surrounding room is large and therefore behaves as a blackbody.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysis: The system may be viewed as a three-surface enclosure, with the third surface being the large surrounding room, which behaves as a blackbody. We are interested in obtaining the net rate of radiation transfer to surface 2. We solve the problem using both the radiation network and direct approaches.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Radiation Network Approach The radiation network is constructed by first identifying nodes associated with the radiosities of each surface, as shown in step 1 in the following schematic.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then each radiosity node is connected to each of the other radiosity nodes through the appropriate space resistance, as shown in step 2. We will treat the surroundings as having a large but unspecified area, which introduces difficulty in expressing the space resistances <span class="tex-text">\( (A_{3} F_{31})^{-1} \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\((A_{3} F_{32})^{-1}\)</span>. Fortunately, from the reciprocity relation (Equation 13.3 <span class="tex-text">\( A_{i} F_{ij} = A_{j} F_{ji}\)</span>), we can replace <span class="tex-text">\( A_{3} F_{31} \)</span> with <span class="tex-text">\( A_{1} F_{13}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(A_{3} F_{32}\)</span> with <span class="tex-text">\( A_{2} F_{23} \)</span>, which are more readily obtained. The final step is to connect the blackbody emissive powers associated with the temperature of each sur-face to the radiosity nodes, using the appropriate form of the surface resistance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this problem, the surface resistance associated with surface 3 is zero according to assumption 4; therefore, <span class="tex-text">\( J_{3} = E_{b3} = \sigma T^{4}_{3} =459 W/m^{2}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Summing currents at the <span class="tex-text">\(J_{1}\)</span> node yields</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\sigma T^{4}_{1} &#8211; J_{1}}{( 1- \varepsilon _{1})/\varepsilon _{1} A_{1}} = \frac{J_{1} &#8211; J_{2}}{1/ A_{1} F_{12} } + \frac{J_{1} -\sigma T^{4}_{3}}{1/ A_{1} F_{13} } \)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
while summing the currents at the <span class="tex-text">\(J_{2}\)</span> node results in</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\sigma T^{4}_{2} &#8211; J_{2}}{( 1- \varepsilon _{2})/\varepsilon _{2} A_{2}} = \frac{J_{2} &#8211; J_{1}}{1/ A_{1} F_{12} } + \frac{J_{2} -\sigma T^{4}_{3}}{1/ A_{2} F_{23} } \)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The view factor <span class="tex-text">\(F_{12}\)</span> may be obtained by recognizing that <span class="tex-text">\(F_{12} = F_{12^{\prime }}\)</span>, where <span class="tex-text">\(A^{\prime }_{2}\)</span> is shown in the schematic as the rectangular base of the absorber surface. Then, from Figure 13.4 or Table 13.2, with Y/L = 10/1 = 10 and X/L = 1/1 = 1,</p>

From the summation rule, and recognizing that <span class="tex-text">\(F_{11} \)</span>= 0, it also follows that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(F_{13} = 1 &#8211; F_{12} = 1 &#8211; 0.39 = 0.61\)</span> <p class="blog">
The last needed view factor is <span class="tex-text">\(F_{23}\)</span>. We recognize that, since radiation propagating from sur-face 2 to surface 3 must pass through the hypothetical surface <span class="tex-text">\(A^{\prime }_{2}\)</span>,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_{2} F_{23} = A^{\prime }_{2} F_{2^{\prime }3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
and from symmetry <span class="tex-text">\(F_{2^{\prime }3} = F_{13}\)</span>. Thus</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(F_{23} = \frac{A^{\prime }_{2}}{A_{2}} F_{13} = \frac{10 m^{2}}{15 m^{2}} × 0.61 = 0.41\)</span> <p class="blog">
We may now solve Equations 1 and 2 for <span class="tex-text">\(J_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(J_{2}\)</span>. Recognizing that <span class="tex-text">\( E_{b1}= \sigma T^{4}_{1} = 56,700 W/m^{2}\)</span> and canceling the area <span class="tex-text">\( A_1\)</span> , we can express Equation 1 as</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{56,700 &#8211; J_{1}}{(1 &#8211; 0.9)/0.9} = \frac{J_{1} &#8211; J_{2}}{1/0.39} + \frac{ J_{1} &#8211; 459}{1/0.61}\)</span> <p class="blog">
or<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(-10J_{1}+ 0.39 J_{2} = &#8211; 510,582\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Noting that <span class="tex-text">\(E_{b2}= \sigma T^{4}_{2} = 7348 W/m^{2}\)</span> and dividing by the area <span class="tex-text">\(A_{2}\)</span>, we can express Equation 2 as</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{7348 &#8211; J_{2}}{(1 &#8211; 0.5)/0.5} = \frac{J_{2} &#8211; J_{1}}{15 m^{2}/(10 m^{2} × 0.39)} + \frac{J_{2} &#8211; 459}{1/0.41} \)</span> <p class="blog">
or</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(0.26J_{1} &#8211; 1.67J_{2} = -7536 \)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving Equations 3 and 4 simultaneously yields <span class="tex-text">\(J_{2} = 12,487 W/m^{2}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
An expression for the net rate of heat transfer from the absorber surface, <span class="tex-text">\(q_{2}\)</span>, may be written upon inspection of the radiation network and is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(q_{2} = \frac{\sigma T^{4}_{2} &#8211; J_{2}}{(1 &#8211; \varepsilon _{2})/ \varepsilon _{2} A_{2}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
resulting in</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(q_{2} = \frac{(7348 &#8211; 12,487)W/m^{2}}{(1 &#8211; 0.5)/(0.5 × 15 m^{2})} = -77.1 kW \)</span> <p class="blog">
Hence, the net heat transfer rate to the absorber is <span class="tex-text">\(q_{net} = -q_{2} = 77.1 kW.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Direct Approach Using the direct approach, we write Equation 13.21 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{E_{bi} &#8211; J_{i}}{(1 &#8211; \varepsilon _{i})/ \varepsilon _{i} A_{i}} =\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}{\frac{J_{i} &#8211; J_{j}}{(A_{i} F_{ij})^{-1}} } \)</span>for each of the three surfaces. We use reciprocity to rewrite the space resistances in terms of the known view factors from above and to eliminate <span class="tex-text">\(A_{3}\)</span>.</p>

Substituting values of the areas, temperatures, emissivities, and view factors into Equations 5 through 7 and solving them simultaneously, we obtain <span class="tex-text">\(J_{1} = 51,541 W/m^{2},J_{2} = 12,487 W/m^{2}\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(J_{3} = 459 W/m^{2}\)</span>. Equation 13.19 <span class="tex-text">\( q_{i} =\frac{E_{bi} &#8211; J_{i}}{(1 &#8211; \varepsilon _{i})/ \varepsilon _{i} A_{i}}\)</span> may then be written for surface 2 as</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(q_{2} = \frac{\sigma T^{4}_{2} &#8211; J_{2}}{(1 &#8211; \varepsilon _{2})/ \varepsilon _{2} A_{2}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
This expression is identical to the expression that was developed using the radiation network. Hence, <span class="tex-text">\(q_{2} = -77.1 kW.\)</span></p>

Comments:<br /> 1. In order to solve Equations 5 through 7 simultaneously, we must first multiply both sides of Equation 7 by <span class="tex-text">\((1 &#8211; ε_{3})/ε_{3} A_{3} = 0\)</span> to avoid division by zero, resulting in the simplified form of Equation 7, which is <span class="tex-text">\(J_{3} = \sigma T^{4}_{3} .\)</span><br /> 2. If we substitute <span class="tex-text">\(J_{3} = \sigma T^{4}_{3} \)</span> into Equations 5 and 6, it is evident that Equations 5 and 6 are identical to Equations 1 and 2, respectively.<br /> 3. The direct approach is recommended for problems involving N ≥ 4 surfaces, since radiation networks become quite complex as the number of surfaces increases.<br /> 4. As will be seen in Section 13.4, the radiation network approach is particularly useful when thermal energy is transferred to or from surfaces by additional means, that is, by conduction and/or convection. In these multimode heat transfer situations, the addi-tional energy delivered to or taken from the surface can be represented by additional current into or out of a node.<br /> 5. Recognize the utility of using a hypothetical surface ( <span class="tex-text">\(A^{\prime }_{2}\)</span>) to simplify the evaluation of view factors.<br /> 6. We could have approached the solution in a slightly different manner. Radiation leav-ing surface 1 must pass through the openings (hypothetical surface <span class="tex-text">\(3^{\prime }\)</span>) in order to reach the surroundings. Thus, we can write.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(F_{13} = F_{13^{\prime }}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1} F_{13} = A_{1} F_{13^{\prime }} = A^{\prime }_{3} F_{3^{\prime }1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
A similar relationship can be written for exchange between surface 2 and the surround-ings, that is <span class="tex-text">\(A_{2} F_{23} = A^{\prime }_{3} F_{3^{\prime }2}\)</span> , . Thus, the space resistances which connect to radiosity node 3 in the radiation network above can be replaced by space resistances pertaining to surface <span class="tex-text">\(3^{\prime }\)</span>. The resistance network would be unchanged, and the space resistances would have the same values as those determined in the foregoing solution. However, it may be more con-venient to calculate the view factors by utilizing the hypothetical surfaces <span class="tex-text">\(3^{\prime }\)</span>. With the sur-face resistance for surface 3 equal to zero, we see that openings of enclosures that exchange radiation with large surroundings may be treated as hypothetical, nonreflecting black surfaces (<span class="tex-text">\(ε_{3}\)</span> = 1) whose temperature is equal to that of the surroundings <span class="tex-text">\((T_{3} = T_{sur})\)</span>.<br /> 7. The heater and absorber surfaces would not be characterized by uniform irradiation or radiosity. The calculated heat rate could be checked by dividing the heater and absorber into subsurfaces, and repeating the analysis.</p>
