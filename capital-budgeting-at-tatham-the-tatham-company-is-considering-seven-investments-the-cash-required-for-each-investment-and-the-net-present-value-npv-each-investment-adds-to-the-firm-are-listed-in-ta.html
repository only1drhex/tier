            <p class="blog"><strong>CAPITAL BUDGETING AT TATHAM </strong></p> <p class="blog">The Tatham Company is considering seven investments. The cash required for each investment and the net present value (NPV) each investment adds to the firm are listed in Table 14.5. Each NPV is based on a stream of future revenues, and it includes the cash requirement, which is incurred right away. The table also lists the return of investment (ROI) for each investment, defined as the ratio of NPV to cash required, minus 1. The budget for investment is $15 million. Tatham wants to find the investment policy that maximizes its total NPV. The crucial assumption here is that if Tatham wants to take part in any of these investments, it must go all the way. It cannot, for example, go halfway in investment 1 by investing $2.5 million and realizing an NPV of $2.8 million. In fact, if partial investments were allowed, you wouldn’t need IP; you could use LP.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="303"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="4" width="303">Table 14.5 Data for the Capital Budgeting Example ($ millions)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Investment</td> <td>Cash Required</td> <td>NPV</td> <td>ROI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>$5.0</td> <td>$5.6</td> <td>12.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>$2.4</td> <td>$2.7</td> <td>12.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>$3.5</td> <td>$3.9</td> <td>11.4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>$5.9</td> <td>$6.8</td> <td>15.3%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>$6.9</td> <td>$7.7</td> <td>11.6%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>$4.5</td> <td>$5.1</td> <td>13.3%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>$3.0</td> <td>$3.3</td> <td>10.0%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use binary IP to find the set of investments that stays within budget and maximizes total NPV.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The initial required cash and the available budget are easy to obtain.

The variables and constraints required for this model appear in Figure 14.43. (See the file Capital Budgeting Big Picture. xlsx.) The most important part is that the decision variables must be binary, where a 1 means that an investment is chosen and a 0 means that it isn’t. These variables cannot have fractional values such as 0.5, because partial investments are not allowed. When you set up the Solver dialog box, you must add explicit binary constraints in the Constraints section.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
To form the spreadsheet model, which is shown in Figure 14.44, proceed as follows. (See the file Capital Budgeting Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the initial cash requirements, the NPVs, and the budget in the blue ranges. The ROIs aren’t absolutely required, but you can calculate them in row 7.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. 0–1 values for investments. Enter any trial 0–1 values for the investments in row 10. Actually, you can even enter fractional values such as 0.5 in these cells. Solver’s binary constraints will eventually force them to be 0 or 1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Cash invested. Calculate the total cash invested in cell B14 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B5:H5,Decisions)</p>
 <p class="blog">
A SUMPRODUCT formula, where one of the ranges has 0–1 values, just sums the values in the other range that correspond to the I’s.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that this formula sums the costs only for those investments with 0–1 variables equal to 1. To see this, think how the SUMPRODUCT function works when one of its ranges is a 0–1 range. It effectively sums the cells in the other range corresponding to the 1’s.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. NPV contribution. Calculate the NPV contributed by the investments in cell B17 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B6:H6,Decisions)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Again, this sums only the NPVs of the investments with 0–1 variables equal to 1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box appears in Figure 14.45. The objective is to maximize the total NPV while staying within the budget. However, the decision variable cells must be constrained to be 0–1. Solver makes this simple, as shown in Figure 14.46. You add a constraint with the decision variable cells in the left box and choose the bin option in the middle box. The word “binary” in the right box is then added automatically. Note that if all decision variable cells are binary, the Non-Negative option is optional (because 0 and 1 are certainly nonnegative), but you should still choose the Simplex LP method if the model is linear, as it is here.<span class="tex-text">\(^{12}\)</span> Finally, in the Solver Options dialog box, you should make sure the Ignore Integer Constraints option is not checked.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solver makes it easy to specify binary constraints, by choosing the bin option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution in Figure 14.44 indicates that Tatham can obtain a maximum NPV of $16.7 million by selecting investments 3, 5, and 6. These three investments consume only $14.9 million of the available budget, with $100,000 left over. However, this $100,000 is not nearly enough—because of the “investing all the way” requirement—to invest in any of the remaining investments.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If Tatham’s investments are ranked on the basis of ROI (see row 7 of Figure 14.44), the ranking from best to worst is 4, 6, 2, 5, 1, 3, 7. Using your economic intuition, you might expect the investments to be chosen in this order—until the budget runs out. However, the optimal solution does not do this. It selects the second-, fourth-, and sixth-best investments, and it ignores the best. To understand why it does this, imagine investing in the order from best to worst, according to row 7, until the budget allows no more. By the time you have chosen investments 4, 6, and 2, you will have consumed $12.8 million of the budget, and the remainder, $2.2 million, is not sufficient to invest in any of the rest. This strategy provides an NPV of only $14.6 million. A smarter strategy, the optimal solution from Solver, gains you an extra $2.1 million in NPV.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
SolverTable can be used on models with binary variables exactly as you have used it in previous models.<span class="tex-text">\(^{13}\)</span> Here you can use it to see how the total NPV varies as the budget increases. Select the Budget cell as the single input cell, allow it to vary from $15 million to $25 million in increments of $1 million, and keep track of the total investment cost, the total NPV, and the binary variables. The results are shown in Figure 14.47. Clearly, Tatham can achieve a larger NPV with a larger budget, but as the increases in column K indicate, each extra $1 million of budget does not have the same effect on total NPV. Note also how the selected investments vary as the budget increases. This somewhat strange behavior is due to the “lumpiness” of the inputs and the all-or-nothing nature of the problem.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Effect of Solver Integer Optimality Setting</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
To illustrate the effect of the Solver Integer Optimality setting, compare the SolverTable results in Figure 14.48 with those in Figure 14.47. Each is for the Tatham capital budgeting model, but Figure 14.48 uses Solver’s (old) default setting of 5%, whereas Figure 14.47 uses a setting of 0%. The four shaded cells in Figure 14.48 indicate lower total NPVs than the corresponding cells in Figure 14.47. In these three cases, Solver stopped short of finding the true optimal solutions because it found solutions within the 5% of the optimal objective value and then quit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When the Integer Optimality setting is 5% instead of 0%, Solver’s solution might not be optimal, but it will be close.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Capital budgeting models with cash requirements in multiple time periods can also be handled. Figure 14.49 shows one possibility. (See the Capital Budgeting Multiple Period Finished.xlsx file.) The costs in rows 5 and 6 are both incurred if any given investment is selected. Now there are two budget constraints, one in each year, but otherwise the model is exactly as before. Note that some investments can have a zero cost in year 1 and a positive cost in year 2. This effectively means that these investments are undertaken in year 2 rather than year 1. Also, it is easy to modify the model to incorporate costs in years 3, 4, and so on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• If Tatham could choose a fractional amount of an investment, you could maximize its NPV by deleting the binary constraint. The optimal solution to the resulting LP model has a total NPV of $17.064 million. All of investments 2, 4, and 6, and 44% of investment 1 are chosen.<span class="tex-text">\(^{14}\)</span> However, there is no way to round the decision variable cell values from this LP solution to obtain the optimal IP solution. Sometimes the solution to an IP model without the integer constraints bears little resemblance to the optimal IP solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Any IP model involving 0–1 variables with only one constraint is called a knapsack problem. Think of the problem faced by a hiker going on an overnight hike. For example, suppose that the hiker’s knapsack can hold only 35 pounds, and she must choose which of several available items to take on the hike. The benefit derived from each item is analogous to the NPV of each project, and the weight of each item is analogous to the cash required by each investment. The single constraint is analogous to the budget constraint—that is, only 35 pounds can fit in the knapsack. In a knapsack problem, the goal is to get the most value in the knapsack without overloading it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
12 All the models in this section satisfy two of the three properties of linear models in Chapter 13: proportionality and additivity. Even though they clearly violate the third assumption, divisibility, which precludes integer constraints, they are still considered linear by Solver. Therefore, you should still choose the Simplex LP method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
13 As mentioned earlier, Solver’s sensitivity report is not even available for models with integer constraints because the mathematical theory behind the report changes significantly when variables are constrained to be integers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
14 If you try this with the Capital Budgeting.xlsx file, delete the binary constraint, but don’t forget to constrain the decision variables to be nonnegative and less than or equal to 1.</p>
