            <p class="blog">Understanding Economic “Equivalence”</p> <p class="blog">Enrico Suarez just graduated with a B.S. in engineering and landed a new job with a starting annual salary of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 48,000\)</span>. There are a number of things that he would like to do with his newfound &#8220;wealth.&#8221; For starters, he needs to begin repaying his student loans (totaling <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 20,000\)</span> ) and he d like to reduce some outstanding balances on credit cards (totaling <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 5,000\)</span> ). Enrico also needs to purchase a car to get to work and would like to put money aside to purchase a condo in the future. Last, but not least, he wants to put some money aside for his eventual retirement.</p> <p class="blog">Our recent graduate needs to do some financial planning for which he has selected a 10-year time frame. At the end of 10 years, he&#8217;d like to have paid off his current student loan and credit card debt, as well as have accumulated <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 40,000\)</span> for a down payment on a condo. If possible, Enrico would like to put aside <span class="tex-text">\(10 \%\)</span> of his take home salary for retirement. He has gathered the following information to assist him in his planning.*</p> <ul> <li>Student loans are typically repaid in equal monthly installments over a period of 10 years. The interest rate on Enrico&#8217;s loan is <span class="tex-text">\(8 \%\)</span> compounded monthly.</li> <li>Credit cards vary greatly in the interest rate charged. Typical APR rates are close to <span class="tex-text">\(17 \%\)</span>, and monthly minimum payments are usually computed using a 10-year repayment period. The interest rate on Enrico&#8217;s credit card is <span class="tex-text">\(18 \%\)</span> compounded monthly.</li> <li>Car loans are usually repaid over three, four, or five years. The APR on a car loan can be as low as <span class="tex-text">\(2.9 \%\)</span> (if the timing is right) or as high as <span class="tex-text">\(12 \%\)</span>. As a first-time car buyer, Enrico can secure a <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 15,000\)</span> car loan at <span class="tex-text">\(9 \%\)</span> compounded monthly to be repaid over 60 months.</li> <li>A 30-year, fixed rate mortgage is currently going for 5.75%-6.0% per year. If Enrico can save enough to make a <span class="tex-text">\(20 \%\)</span> down payment on the purchase of his condo, he can avoid private mortgage insurance that can cost as much as <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 60\)</span> per month.</li> <li>Investment opportunities can provide variable returns. &#8220;Safe&#8221; investments can guarantee <span class="tex-text">\(7 \%\)</span> per year, while &#8220;risky&#8221; investments could return <span class="tex-text">\(30 \%\)</span> or more per year.</li> <li>Enrico&#8217;s parents and older siblings have reminded him that his monthly take home pay will be reduced by income taxes and benefit deductions. He should not count on being able to spend more than <span class="tex-text">\(80 \%\)</span> of his gross salary.</li> </ul> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\({ }^{*}\)</span> The stated problem data are current as of 2014 .</p> <p class="blog">As Enrico&#8217;s friend (and the one who took Engineering Economy instead of Appreciating the Art of Television Commercials), you have been asked to review his financial plans. How reasonable are his goals?</p>

Since all repayments are done on a monthly basis, it makes sense to adopt the month as Enrico&#8217;s unit of time. There are five categories for his cash flows: debt repayment, transportation costs, housing costs, other living expenses, and savings. The following paragraphs summarize his estimates of monthly expenses in each of these categories.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Debt Repayment</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Enrico&#8217;s student loan debt is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 20,000\)</span> and is to be repaid over the next 120 months (10 years) at a nominal interest rate of <span class="tex-text">\(8 \%\)</span> compounded monthly <span class="tex-text">\(\left(i_{\text {month }}=8 / 12 \%=\right.\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(2 / 3 \%)\)</span>. His monthly loan payment is then</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(A_{\text {Student Loan }}=\$ 20,000(A / P, 2 / 3 \%, 120)=\$ 20,000(0.01213)=\$ 242.60\)</span> per month.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Enrico&#8217;s credit card debt is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 5,000\)</span> and is to be completely repaid over the next 120 months at a nominal interest rate of <span class="tex-text">\(18 \%\)</span> compounded monthly <span class="tex-text">\(\left(i_{\text {month }}=1.5 \%\right)\)</span>. His monthly credit card payment, assuming no additional usage, is then</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(A_{\text {Credit Card }}=\$ 5,000(A / P, 1.5 \%, 120)=\$ 5,000(0.01802)=\$ 90.10\)</span> per month.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Enrico&#8217;s monthly debt repayment totals <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 242.60+\$ 90.10=\$ 332.70\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Transportation Costs</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The certified pre-owned vehicle Enrico would like to buy costs <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 15,000\)</span>. The best rate he can find as a first-time car buyer with no assets or credit history is <span class="tex-text">\(9 \%\)</span> compounded monthly with a 60 -month repayment period. Based on these figures, his monthly car payment will be</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_{\text {Car }}=\$ 15,000(A / P, 0.75 \%, 60)=\$ 15,000(0.02076)=\$ 311.40 \text { per month } .\)</span> <p class="blog">
Even though the car will be completely repaid after five years, Enrico knows that he will eventually need to replace the car. To accumulate funds for the replacement of the car, he wants to continue to set aside this amount each month for the second five years.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Insurance for this vehicle will cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 1,200\)</span> per year, and Enrico has budgeted <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 100\)</span> per month to cover fuel and maintenance. Thus, his monthly transportation costs total <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 311.40+\$ 1,200 / 12+\$ 100=\$ 511.40\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Housing Costs</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
A nice two-bedroom apartment near Enrico&#8217;s place of work has a monthly rent of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 800\)</span>. The rental office provided him with a monthly utility cost estimate of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 150\)</span> to cover water and electricity. Based on this information, <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 800+\$ 150=\$ 950\)</span> per month has been budgeted for his housing costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Other Living Expenses</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
This expense category has troubled Enrico the most. While all the previous categories are pretty straightforward, he knows that his day-to-day spending will have the most variability and that it will be tempting to overspend. Nonetheless, he has developed the following estimates of monthly living expenses not already covered in the other categories:</p>
 <table width="288"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="224">Food</td> <td width="64">$200</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Phone</td> <td>$70</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Entertainment</td> <td>$100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Miscellaneous</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(clothing, household items)</td> <td>$150</p>
 <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Subtotal</td> <td>$520</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p class="blog">
<strong>Savings</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Enrico wants to accumulate <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 40,000\)</span> over the next 10 years to be used as a down payment on a condo. He feels that if he chooses relatively &#8220;safe&#8221; investments (CDs and bonds), he should be able to earn <span class="tex-text">\(6 \%\)</span> compounded monthly on his savings. He must then set aside</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(A_{\text {Condo }}=\$ 40,000(A / F, 0.5 \%, 120)=\$ 40,000(0.00610)=\$ 244.00\)</span> per month to reach his goal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Enrico&#8217;s gross monthly starting salary is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 48,000 / 12=\$ 4,000\)</span>. Based on the information gathered from his family, he estimates his monthly net (take home) pay to be <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 4,000(0.80)=\$ 3,200\)</span>. His monthly retirement savings will then be <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 3,200(0.10)=\$ 320\)</span>. Thus, the total amount to be set aside each month for the future is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 244+\$ 320=\$ 564\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Monthly Financial Plan</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Based on the preceding calculations, the following table summarizes Enrico&#8217;s monthly financial plan.</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="409"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="168"></td> <td width="124">Net Income</td> <td width="117">Expense</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Salary</td> <td>$3,200</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Debt repayment</td> <td></td> <td>$332.70</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Transportation costs</td> <td></td> <td>511.40</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Housing costs</td> <td></td> <td>950.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Living expenses</td> <td></td> <td>520.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Savings</td> <td></td> <td>564.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>$3,200</td> <td>$2,878.10</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Enrico is aware that he has not explicitly accounted for price increases over the next 10 years; however, neither has he increased his annual salary. He is hopeful that, if he works hard, his annual salary increases will at least cover the increase in the cost of living.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You congratulate your friend on his efforts. You feel that he has covered the major areas of expenses, as well as savings for the future. You note that he has <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 3,200-\$ 2,878.10=\$ 321.90\)</span> of &#8220;extra&#8221; money each month to cover unanticipated costs. With this much leeway, you feel that he should have no problem meeting his financial goals.</p>
