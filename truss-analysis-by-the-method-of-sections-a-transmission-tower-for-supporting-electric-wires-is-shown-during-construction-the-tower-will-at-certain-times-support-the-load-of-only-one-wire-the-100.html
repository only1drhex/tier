Road Map A quick inspection of the members of interest in Fig. 1 indicates that because of the number of unknowns involved with any candidate cut (some possible cuts are shown in Fig. 2), use of the method of sections will not be as straightforward as in . Although we will use the method of sections in this example, more generally you should also consider the method of joints, or a combination of these, and select the approach that is most efficient.<span class="tex-text">\(^â€ \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Before proceeding, by inspection we observe that there are eight zero-force members present in Fig. 1: JM, JP , KO, KQ, IJ , AJ, IM, and MP. Given the complexity of this truss, we may also suspect that it is statically indeterminate. While we do not have details of the entire structure and thus cannot make a definitive determination, if we imagine that joints G and H are supported by a pin and roller, respectively, then the truss has the number of members m = 31, number of support reactions r = 3, and number of joints j = 17, and the truss is fully fixed. Application of Eq. (If m + r &lt; 2j The truss is a mechanism and/or has partial fixity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If m + r = 2j The truss is statically determinate if it has full fixity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The truss is statically indeterminate if it has partial fixity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If m + r &gt; 2j The truss is statically indeterminate, and it can have full fixity or partial fixity.) on p. 349 shows m + r = 2j ; and since the truss is fully fixed, it is statically determinate, and we should be able to determine the desired member forces.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling Cut aa shown in Fig. 2 passes through all of the members we are interested in. But, because the resulting FBD will contain four unknowns, additional FBDs will be needed so that additional equilibrium equations can be written. Cut bb could be used, and while this also results in an FBD with four unknowns, two of these are the same as those from cut aa. Thus, this solution strategy will work: draw two FBDs, one for cut aa and one for cut bb, and write equilibrium expressions to obtain six equations with six unknowns.</p>
 <p class="blog">
While the foregoing strategy is straightforward, some additional thought gives a clever solution using cut cc, which results in the FBD shown in Fig. 3: while it has four unknowns, it is nonetheless possible to determine two of these. Then cut aa, with the FBD shown in Fig. 4, can be used to obtain the remaining unknowns.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation Using cut cc, the FBD is shown in Fig. 3. We cannot determine <span class="tex-text">\(F_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F_{BC}\)</span>, but we can determine the remaining unknowns as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_A}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-(1500 lb)(40 in.) &#8211; (1000 lb)(60 in.) &#8211; F_{CE}(30 in.) = 0\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow F_{CE} = -4000 lb\)</span>, (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-F_{AD} &#8211; F_{CE} &#8211; 1000 lb = 0\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow F_{AD} = 3000 lb\)</span>. (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then consider the FBD for cut aa, shown in Fig. 4. Since there are now only two unknowns, only two equilibrium equations are needed, and we elect to use the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(1500 lb &#8211; F_{BD}(\frac{15}{25}) + F_{BE}(\frac{15}{25}) = 0\)</span> (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-F_{AD} &#8211; F_{BD}(\frac{20}{25}) &#8211; F_{BE}(\frac{20}{25}) &#8211; F_{CE} &#8211; 1000 lb = 0\)</span>. (6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving Eqs. (5) and (6) provides</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow F_{BD} = 1250 lb\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F_{BE} = -1250 lb\)</span>. (7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Discussion &amp; Verification As an alternative to the solution followed here, use of cuts aa and bb is also a good solution strategy, although it entails more algebra. Nonetheless, you may wish to use this strategy, and you should obtain the same solution. If you are using a computer to solve the equilibrium equations, then the extra algebra is irrelevant.</p>

* Safety during construction is a difficult and sometimes overlooked aspect of the overall design of structures.<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(^â€ \)</span> After examining Fig. 1, hopefully you determined that for this problem, the method of sections is likely more efficient than the method of joints.</p>
