Workings<br /> 20X1 closing inventory was overstated by $70,000. This resulted in cost of sales being overstated and 20X1 profit and retained earnings being understated. Following the correction, 20X1 cost of sales is restated at $290,000 ($220,000 + $70,000). Profit before tax is now restated at $40,000 and income tax (at 30%) recalculated at $12,000.<br /> The 20X2 cost of sales is correctly recorded at $180,000 ($250,000 less $70,000 overstatement of opening inventory charged to cost of sales in the draft accounts).</p>
