            <p class="blog">GREENHOUSE GASES AND RAINWATER (CIVIL/ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING)</p> <p class="blog">Civil engineering is a broad field that includes such diverse areas as structural, geotechnical, transportation, water-resources, and environmental engineering. The last area has traditionally dealt with pollution control. However, in recent years, environmental engineers (as well as chemical engineers) have addressed broader problems such as climate change. It is well documented that the atmospheric levels of several greenhouse gases have been increasing over the past 50 years. For example, Fig. 8.1 shows data for the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (<span class="tex-text">\(CO_2\)</span>) collected at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, from 1958 through 2003. The trend in the data can be nicely fi t with a quadratic polynomial (in Part Five, we will learn how to determine such polynomials),</p> <span class="tex-text">\(p_{ CO _{2}}=0.011825(t-1980.5)^{2}+1.356975(t-1980.5)+339\)</span> <p class="blog">where <span class="tex-text">\(p _{ CO _{2}}\)</span> = the partial pressure of <span class="tex-text">\(CO_2\)</span> in the atmosphere [ppm]. The data indicate that levels have increased over 19% during the period from 315 to 376 ppm.</p> <p class="blog">Aside from global warming, greenhouse gases can also influence atmospheric chemistry. One question that we can address is how the carbon dioxide trend is affecting the pH of rainwater. Outside of urban and industrial areas, it is well documented that carbon dioxide is the primary determinant of the pH of the rain. pH is the measure of the activity of hydrogen ions and, therefore, its acidity. For dilute aqueous solutions, it can be computed as</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\( pH =-\log _{10}\left[ H ^{+}\right] \)</span> (8.5)</p> <p class="blog">where <span class="tex-text">\([H^+] \)</span> is the molar concentration of hydrogen ions.</p> <p class="blog">The following five nonlinear system of equations govern the chemistry of rainwater</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(K_{1}=10^{6} \frac{\left[ H ^{+}\right]\left[ HCO _{3}^{-}\right]}{K_{H} p_{ CO _{2}}}\)</span> (8.6)</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(K_{2}=\frac{\left[ H ^{+}\right]\left[ CO _{3}^{2-}\right]}{\left[ HCO _{3}^{-}\right]}\)</span> (8.7)</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(K_{w}=\left[ H ^{+}\right]\left[ OH ^{-}\right]\)</span> (8.8)</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(c_{T}=\frac{K_{H} p_{C O_{2}}}{10^{6}}+\left[ HCO _{3}^{-}\right]+\left[ CO _{3}^{2-}\right]\)</span> (8.9)</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(0=\left[ HCO _{3}^{-}\right]+2\left[ CO _{3}^{2-}\right]+\left[ OH ^{-}\right]-\left[ H ^{+}\right]\)</span> (8.10)</p> <p class="blog">where <span class="tex-text">\(K_H\)</span> = Henry’s constant, and <span class="tex-text">\(K_1, K_2\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(K_w\)</span> are equilibrium coefficients. The five unknowns in this system of five nonlinear equations are <span class="tex-text">\(c_T \)</span> = total inorganic carbon, [ <span class="tex-text">\(HCO^{-2}_3 \)</span>] = bicarbonate, [ <span class="tex-text">\(CO^{-2}_3 \)</span> ] = carbonate, <span class="tex-text">\([H^+] \)</span> = hydrogen ion, and [ <span class="tex-text">\(OH^- \)</span>] =hydroxyl ion. Notice how the partial pressure of <span class="tex-text">\(CO_2 \)</span> shows up in Eqs. (8.6) and (8.9). Use these equations to compute the pH of rainwater given that <span class="tex-text">\(K_H \)</span> = 1021.46, <span class="tex-text">\( K_1 = 10^{-6.3}, K_2 = 10^{-10.3} \)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(K_w = 10^{-14} \)</span>. Compare the results in 1958 when the <span class="tex-text">\(p_{CO2}\)</span> was 315 and in 2003 when it was 375 ppm. When selecting a numerical method for your computation, consider the following:</p> <p class="blog">• You know with certainty that the pH of rain in pristine areas always falls between 2 and 12.</p> <p class="blog">• You also know that your measurement devices can only measure pH to two places of decimal precision.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/8.1-3-768x441.png"></div>

There are a variety of ways to solve this nonlinear system of five equations. One way is to eliminate unknowns by combining them to produce a single function that only depends on <span class="tex-text">\([H^+] \)</span>. To do this, first solve Eqs. (8.6) and (8.7) for</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\left[ HCO _{3}^{-}\right]=\frac{K_{1}}{10^{6}\left[ H ^{+}\right]} K_{H} p_{ CO _{2}}\)</span> (8.11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\left[ CO _{3}^{2-}\right]=\frac{K_{2}\left[ HCO _{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[ H ^{+}\right]}\)</span> (8.12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substitute Eq. (8.11) into (8.12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\left[ CO _{3}^{2-}\right]=\frac{K_{2} K_{1}}{10^{6}\left[ H ^{+}\right]^{2}} K_{H} p_{C O_{2}}\)</span> (8.13)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equations (8.11) and (8.13) can be substituted along with Eq. (8.8) into Eq. (8.10) to give</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(0=\frac{K_{1}}{10^{6}\left[ H ^{+}\right]} K_{H} p_{C O_{2}}+2 \frac{K_{2} K_{1}}{10^{6}\left[ H ^{+}\right]^{2}} K_{H} p_{C O_{2}}+\frac{K_{w}}{\left[ H ^{+}\right]}-\left[ H ^{+}\right]\)</span> (8.14)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although it might not be apparent, this result is a third-order polynomial in <span class="tex-text">\([H^+] \)</span>. Thus, its root can be used to compute the pH of the rainwater.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now we must decide which numerical method to employ to obtain the solution. There are two reasons why bisection would be a good choice. First, the fact that the pH always falls within the range from 2 to 12 provides us with two good initial guesses. Second, because the pH can only be measured to two decimal places of precision, we will be satisfied with an absolute error of <span class="tex-text">\(E_{a, d}=0.005\)</span>. Remember that given an initial bracket and the desired relative error, we can compute the number of iterations a priori. Using Eq. (5.5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(n=\frac{\log \left(\Delta x^{0} / E_{a, d}\right)}{\log 2}=\log _{2}\left(\frac{\Delta x^{0}}{E_{a, d}}\right)\)</span> (5.5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
, the result is <span class="tex-text">\(n=\log _{2}(10) / 0.005=10.9658\)</span>. Thus, eleven iterations of bisection will produce the desired precision.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If this is done, the result for 1958 will be a pH of 5.6279 with a relative error of 0.0868%. We can be confident that the rounded result of 5.63 is correct to two decimal places. This can be verified by performing another run with more iterations. For example, if we perform 35 iterations, a result of 5.6304 is obtained with an approximate relative<br /> error of <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon_{a}=5.17 \times 10^{-9} \%\)</span>. The same calculation can be repeated for the 2003 conditions to give pH 5 5.59 with <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon_{a}=0.0874 \%\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Interestingly, these results indicate that the 19% rise in atmospheric <span class="tex-text">\(CO_2\)</span> levels has produced only a 0.67% drop in pH. Although this is certainly true, remember that the pH represents a logarithmic scale as defined by Eq. (8.5). Consequently, a unit drop in<br /> pH represents a 10-fold increase in hydrogen ion. The concentration can be computed as [<span class="tex-text">\(H^+] = 10^{-pH}\)</span> and the resulting percent change can be calculated as 9.1%. Therefore, the hydrogen ion concentration has increased about 9%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is quite a lot of controversy related to the true significance of the greenhouse gas trends. However, regardless of the ultimate implications, it is quite sobering to realize that something as large as our atmosphere has changed so much over a relatively short time<br /> period. This case study illustrates how numerical methods can be employed to analyze and interpret such trends. Over the coming years, engineers and scientists can hopefully use such tools to gain increased understanding and help rationalize the debate over their ramifications.</p>
