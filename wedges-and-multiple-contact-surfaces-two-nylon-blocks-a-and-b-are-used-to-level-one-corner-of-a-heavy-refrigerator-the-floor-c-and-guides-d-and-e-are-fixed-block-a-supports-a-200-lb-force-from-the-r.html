Road Map We will neglect the weights of the blocks, will assume the system is initially at rest, and will analyze motion due to sliding only (i.e., we assume the blocks will not tip). Because block A is a loose fit between guides D and E, it will make contact with D or E, but not both at the same time. In Part (a), block B slides to the right while block A is raised: there are three surfaces in contact and the kinematics are such that if one of these surfaces slides, then they all must slide. In Part (b), if this is a good design, there will be no sliding when P D 0. If sliding does occur, B will move to the left and A will be lowered, and the FBDs from Part (a) will be revised accordingly.</p>

Part (b)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling We assume the system is in equilibrium with no sliding, and at the end of the solution we must verify this assumption. The FBDs are shown in Fig. 3, with the following comments. Because we assume there is no sliding, we may not use <span class="tex-text">\(F_1 = \mu N_1, F_2 = \mu N_2\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(F_3 = \mu N_3\)</span>; rather, we are assuming <span class="tex-text">\(F_1 \lt \mu N_1\)</span>, and so on. Thus, <span class="tex-text">\(N_1, F_1, N_2, F_2, N_3\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(F_3\)</span> are six independent unknowns. While we assume there is no sliding, the directions of <span class="tex-text">\(F_1, F_2\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(F_3\)</span> are nonetheless correctly shown for block B sliding to the left and block A moving down.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation The FBDs in Fig. 3 contain six unknowns, and there are only four equilibrium equations available; hence this problem is statically indeterminate.* We proceed by assuming that block A does not contact either of the guides, which is reasonable if there is no sliding. Thus, <span class="tex-text">\(N_3 = F_3 = 0\)</span>. By inspection of Fig. 3, the equation <span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span> for blocks A and B taken together (note that the forces <span class="tex-text">\(N_2\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F_2\)</span> become internal to the FBD and hence they do not appear in this equilibrium equation) provides <span class="tex-text">\(F_1 = 0\)</span> and writing <span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span> provides <span class="tex-text">\(N_1 = 200 lb\)</span>. Finally, the equilibrium equations for block A alone in Fig. 3 (with <span class="tex-text">\(N_3 = F_3 = 0\)</span>) are</p>
 <p class="blog">
Block A: <span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(N_2(\sin 10°) &#8211; F_2(\cos 10°) = 0\)</span>, (10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(N_2(\cos 10°) + F_2(\sin 10°) &#8211; 200 lb = 0\)</span>, (11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow N_2 = 197 lb\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(F_2 = 34.7 lb\)</span>. (12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Values for all six unknowns have been obtained (i.e., <span class="tex-text">\(N_1 = 200 lb, F_1 = 0, N_2 = 197 lb , F_2 = 34.7 lb, N_3 = F_3 = 0\)</span>), and we must now verify that these satisfy Coulomb’s law. Clearly, surface 1 does not slide, and surface 3 is not in contact. For surface 2, Coulomb’s law states that sliding is impending when <span class="tex-text">\(F_2 = \mu N_2 = 39.4 lb\)</span>. Since this value is larger than the result for <span class="tex-text">\(F_2\)</span> obtained in Eq. (12), we conclude that surface 2 does not slide. Hence, the solution we obtained satisfies all equilibrium equations and Coulomb’s law; therefore our initial assumptions were correct, and we may conclude that the system will be at rest when P = 0.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Alternate solution. As an alternative solution, we can demonstrate that a nonzero force is required to slide block B to the left. The solution procedure of Part (a) is repeated and the FBDs in Fig. 4 are used with the following comments. Force Q is defined to be positive in the -x direction. At the outset of this solution, it may not be clear whether block A contacts guide D or E, and in the course of this solution you will find that contact is made at E, whose contact forces are defined to be <span class="tex-text">\(N_4\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F_4\)</span>. Observe that the directions of all friction forces oppose the directions of sliding. Problem 9.13 asks you to carry out this solution, and you should determine that Q = 44.4 lb will cause block A to be lowered. From this we may infer there is no motion when Q = 0, and hence when P = 0.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Discussion &amp; Verification Impending upward motion of block A occurs when P = 128.0 lb, and the system is at rest when P = 0. Hence, this design is acceptable from the point of view that the wedge will not slip out of place when the insertion force P is removed.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
* While one moment equilibrium equation could be written for each of blocks A and B, three additional unknowns in the form of the locations of the contact force systems must also be introduced; hence the problem would remain statically indeterminate.</p>
