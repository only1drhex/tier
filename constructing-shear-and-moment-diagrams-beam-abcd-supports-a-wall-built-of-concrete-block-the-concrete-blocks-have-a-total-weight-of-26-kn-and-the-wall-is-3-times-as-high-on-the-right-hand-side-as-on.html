Road Map We will begin by using the description of the wall’s geometry to determine the distributed force the concrete blocks apply to the beam. We will then use Eq. (<span class="tex-text">\(V_Q = V_P-\underbrace{\int\limits_{x_Q}^{x_P}{w dx} }_{area under w vs. x plot between x_P and x_Q}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(M_Q = M_P + \underbrace{\int\limits_{x_Q}^{x_P}{V dx} }_{area under V vs. x plot between x_P and x_Q}\)</span>) on p. 480 to directly construct the shear and moment diagrams without explicitly determining the shear and moment as functions of position.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling Given the description of the wall’s geometry, we may conclude that the distributed force from the concrete block is as shown in Fig. 2, where we let the value of the distributed force at end A be <span class="tex-text">\(w_0\)</span>, and then the value at end D is <span class="tex-text">\(3w_0\)</span>. Since the total force from the distributed loading must equal the 26 kN weight of the concrete blocks, we may solve for w0 by using*</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(w_0(10m) + \frac{1}{2}(3m)(2w_0) = 26 kN \Rightarrow w_0 = 2 kN/m\)</span>. (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
With this result, the support reactions may then be determined, and you should verify that these are <span class="tex-text">\(B_x = 0, B_y = 7 kN\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(C_y = 19 kN\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation We will directly construct the shear and moment diagrams without finding V and M as functions of position. Equation (<span class="tex-text">\(V_Q = V_P-\underbrace{\int\limits_{x_Q}^{x_P}{w dx} }_{area under w vs. x plot between x_P and x_Q}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(M_Q = M_P + \underbrace{\int\limits_{x_Q}^{x_P}{V dx} }_{area under V vs. x plot between x_P and x_Q}\)</span>) is repeated here as</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_Q = V_P -\underbrace{\int\limits_{x_Q}^{x_P}{w dx} }_{area under w vs. x plot between x_P and x_Q}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(M_Q = M_P + \underbrace{\int\limits_{x_Q}^{x_P}{V dx} }_{area under V vs. x plot between x_P and x_Q}\)</span>. (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where we select points P and Q. Our strategy will be to begin by taking point P to be at the left-hand end of the beam (point A), where the shear and moment are easily found. We will then sequentially work toward the right-hand end of the beam, evaluating areas for the <span class="tex-text">\(w\)</span> vs. <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> diagram and constructing the shear diagram in the process. Once the shear diagram is complete, we will repeat this process to construct the moment diagram.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Shear diagram</p>
 <p class="blog">
By inspection, the shear at A is zero, because end A is unsupported and has no concentrated force applied. Hence,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_A = 0\)</span>, (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_{B^-} = V_A &#8211; (2 \frac{kN}{m})(3m) = -6 kN\)</span>, (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_{B^+} = (V_{B^-}) + B_y = -6 kN + 7 kN = 1 kN\)</span>, (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_{C^-} = (V_{B^+}) &#8211; (2 \frac{kN}{m})(4m) = -7 kN\)</span>, (6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_{C^+} = (V_{C^-}) + C_y = -7 kN + 19 kN = 12 kN\)</span>, (7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_D = 0\)</span>. (8)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this example, the shear at A was determined by inspection. If you are unsure that <span class="tex-text">\(V_A = 0\)</span> (or if end A had a concentrated force or a support), you draw an appropriate FBD of end A, similar to Fig. 3 on p. 483, to determine the shear at this location. Equation (2) is used to write Eqs. (4) and (6), and you should verify the areas that are computed using the w vs. x diagram shown in Fig. 2. Equations (5) and (7) are applications of the results shown in Fig. 8.9 on p. 481. Equation (8) is written by inspection, although a useful check of accuracy would be to use Eq. (2) for</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_D = (V_{C^+}) &#8211; [\frac{2 kN/m + 6 kN/m}{2} (3m)] = 0\)</span>. (9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The shear diagram is shown in Fig. 3 and is constructed as follows. We first plot the values of the shear from Eqs. (3) through (8). Since <span class="tex-text">\(w\)</span> is constant from A to B and from B to C, the shear is linear in those regions; so two straight lines are drawn. As a check on our solutions, you should compute the slopes for the shear between A and B, and B and C, to verify that both are -2 kN/m. Since w is linear between C and D, the shear is quadratic in that region. We use the expression <span class="tex-text">\(dV/dx = -w\)</span> to determine that the slope just to the right of C is -2 kN/m, and the slope at D is -6 kN/m.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Moment diagram</p>
 <p class="blog">
By inspection, the moment at A is zero, because end A is unsupported and has no concentrated moment applied. Also, values of the moment will be the same on each side of the supports at B and C, so there is no need to distinguish between these. Hence,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_A = 0\)</span>, (10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_B = M_A + [\frac{1}{2} (3m)(-6 kN)] = -9 kN\cdot m\)</span>, (11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_C = M_B +[\frac{1 kN + (-7 kN)}{2} (4m)] = -21 kN\cdot m\)</span>, (12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_D = 0\)</span>. (13)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equations (10) and (13) were written by inspection, while Eq. (2) was used to write Eqs. (11) and (12), and you should verify the areas that are computed using the V vs. x diagram shown in Fig. 3.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The moment diagram is shown in Fig. 3 and is constructed as follows. We first plot the values of the moment from Eqs. (10) through (13). Since V is linear from A to B and from B to C, the shear is quadratic in these regions, and between C and D the shear is quadratic so the moment is cubic. We use the expression dM/dx = V to determine the slopes of the moment diagram, given the values of the shear, and this allows us to draw the moment diagram with the correct slopes and curvatures.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Discussion &amp; Verification Numerous checks have been used and suggested in the course of developing this solution. Observe that the moment diagram has a local maximum at about <span class="tex-text">\(x \approx 3.5 m\)</span>, and this location corresponds to V = 0, as expected.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
* While it is obvious that Eq. (1) is valid, we are in fact applying the first expression in Eq. (<span class="tex-text">\((\overrightarrow{F}_R )_{system 1} =(\overrightarrow{F}_R )_{system 2}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\((\overrightarrow{M}_R )_{system 1} =(\overrightarrow{M}_R )_{system 2}\)</span> ) on p. 223 for construction of an equivalent force system.</p>
