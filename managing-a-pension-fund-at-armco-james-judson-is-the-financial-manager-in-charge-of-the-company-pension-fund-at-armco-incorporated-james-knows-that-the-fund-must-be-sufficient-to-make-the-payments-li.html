The variables and constraints required for this pension fund model are shown in Figure 14.38. (See the file Pension Fund Management Big Picture.xlsx.) When modeling this problem, there is a new twist that involves the money James must allocate now for his funding problem. It is clear that he must decide how many bonds of each type to purchase now (note that no bonds are purchased in the future), but he must also decide how much money to allocate from company coffers. This allocated money has to cover the initial pension payment this year and the bond purchases. In addition, James wants to find the minimum allocation that will suffice. Therefore, this initial allocation serves two roles in the model. It is a decision variable and it is the objective to minimize. In terms of spreadsheet modeling, it is perfectly acceptable to make the objective cell one of the decision variable cells, and this is done here. You will not see this in many models—because the objective typically involves a linear combination of several decision variables—but it is occasionally the most natural way to proceed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Objective as a Decision Variable Cell</p>
 <p class="blog">
In all optimization models, the objective cell has to be a function of the decision variable cells, that is, the objective value should change as values in the decision variable cells change. It is perfectly consistent with this requirement to have the objective cell be one of the decision variable cells. This doesn’t occur in very many optimization models, but it is sometimes useful, even necessary.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The completed spreadsheet model is shown in Figure 14.39. (See the file Pension Fund Management Finished.xlsx.) You can create it with the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs and range names. Enter the given data and name the ranges as indicated. Note that the bond costs in the range B5:B7 have been entered as positive quantities. Some financial analysts might prefer that they be entered as negative numbers, indicating outflows. It doesn’t really matter, however, as long as you are careful with the Excel formulas later on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Cash allocated and bonds purchased. As discussed previously, the cash allocated in year 1 and the numbers of bonds purchased are both decision variables, so enter any values for these in the Cash_allocated and Bonds_purchased ranges. Note that the color-coding convention for the Cash_allocated cell has to be modified. Because it is both a decision variable cell and the objective cell, we colored it red but added a note to emphasize that it is the objective to minimize.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Always document your spreadsheet conventions as clearly as possible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Cash available to make payments. In the current year, the only cash available is the money initially allocated minus cash used to purchase bonds. Calculate this quantity in cell B20 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Cash_allocated-SUMPRODUCT(Bonds_purchased,B5:B7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For all other years, the cash available comes from two sources: excess cash invested at the fixed interest rate the year before and payments from bonds. Calculate this quantity for year 1 in cell C20 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=(B20-B22)*(11$B$9)1SUMPRODUCT(Bonds_purchased,C5:C7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy it across row 20 for the other years.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As you can see, this model is fairly straightforward to develop once you understand the role of the amount allocated in cell B16. However, we have often given this problem as an assignment to our students, and many fail to deal correctly with the amount allocated. (They usually forget to make it a decision variable cell.) So make sure you understand what we have done, and why we have done it this way.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The main Solver dialog box should be filled out as shown in Figure 14.40. Once again, notice that the Cash_allocated cell is both the objective cell and one of the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution </strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution appears in Figure 14.39. You might argue that the numbers of bonds purchased should be constrained to integer values. We tried this and the optimal solution changed very little: The optimal numbers of bonds to purchase changed to 74, 79, and 27, and the optimal money to allocate increased to $197,887. With this integer solution, shown in Figure 14.41, James sets aside $197,887 initially. Any less than this would not work—he couldn’t make enough from bonds to meet future pension payments. All but $20,387 of this (see cell B20) is spent on bonds, and of the $20,387, $11,000 is used to make the current pension payment. After this, the amounts in row 20, which are always sufficient to make the payments in row 22, are composed of returns from bonds and cash, with interest, from the previous year. Even more so than in previous examples, there is no way to guess this optimal solution. The timing of bond returns and the irregular pension payments make a spreadsheet optimization model absolutely necessary.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the bond information and pension payments are fixed, there is only one obvious direction for sensitivity analysis: on the fixed interest rate in cell B9. We tried this, allowing this rate to vary from 2% to 6% in increments of 0.5% and keeping track of the optimal decision variable cells, including the objective cell. The results appear in Figure 14.42 (without the integer constraints). They indicate that as the interest rate increases, James can get by with fewer bonds of types 1 and 2, and he can allocate less money for the problem. The reason is that he is making more interest on excess cash.</p>
