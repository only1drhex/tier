We need to make one probabilistic assumption. From that point, it is a matter of “playing out” the games and doing the required bookkeeping. To understand this probabilistic assumption, suppose team A plays team B and Sagarin’s ratings for these teams are, say, 85 and 78. Then Sagarin predicts that the actual point differential in the game (team A’s score minus team B’s score) will be the difference between the ratings, or <span class="tex-text">\( 7 .^{4} \)</span> We take this one step further. We assume that the actual point differential is normally distributed with mean equal to Sagarin’s prediction, 7, and standard deviation 10. (Why 10? This is an estimate based on an extensive analysis of historical data. However, the spreadsheet model is set up so that you can change the standard deviation to a different value if you prefer.) Then if the actual point differential is positive, team A wins. If it is negative, team B wins.</p>

We model the point spread as normally distributed, with mean equal to the difference between the Sagarin ratings and standard deviation 10.</p>

<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We provide only an outline of the simulation model. You can see the full details in the file March Madness 2018.xlsx. (This file includes the data for the 2018 tournament, but you can easily modify it for future tournaments.) The entire simulation is on a single Model sheet. Columns A through C list team indexes, team names, and Sagarin ratings. If two teams are paired in the first round, they are placed next to one another in the list. Also, all teams in a given region are listed together. (The regions are color-coded.) Columns H through N contain the simulation. The first round results are at the top, the second- round results are below these, and so on. Winners from one round are automatically carried over to the next round with appropriate formulas. Selected portions of the model appear in Figure 16.41.This figure shows one possible scenario where Villanova did indeed win. We now describe the essential features of the model. (We didn’t use @RISK in this model.We instead used Excel’s built-in functions and a data table to replicate the results.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Simulate rounds. Jumping ahead to the fourth-round simulation in Figure 16.41, the winners from the previous round 3 are captured, and then the games in round 4 are simulated. The key formulas are in columns H and I. For example, the formulas in cells K137 and J137 are</p>
 <p class="blog">
=VLOOKUP(F137,LTable,3)-VLOOKUP(F138,LTable,3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=NORM.INV(RAND(),K137,$F$3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first of these looks up the ratings of the two teams involved and subtracts to get the predicted point spread. The second formula simulates a point spread with the predicted point spread as its mean and the value in cell F3, 10, as its standard deviation. The rest of the formulas do the appropriate bookkeeping. You can view the details in the file.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Outputs. The model uses a data table to replicate the following outputs for each team: (1) whether the team wins the tournament, (2) whether the team reaches the final game, and (3) whether the team reaches the final four (the semi-finals). Then it shows tallies of these in tabular and graphical form. For example, after one run of 1000 replications, Villanova won the tournament 189 times, reached the final game 284 times, and reached the final four 437 times. They were clearly the favorite entering the tournament, and they backed it up by winning.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 In general, there is also a home-court advantage, but we assume all games in the tournament are on “neutral” courts, so that there is no advantage to either team.</p>
