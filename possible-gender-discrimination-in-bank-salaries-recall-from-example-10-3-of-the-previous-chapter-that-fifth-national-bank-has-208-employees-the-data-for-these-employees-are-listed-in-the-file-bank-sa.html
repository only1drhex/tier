There are several places to look for outliers. An obvious place is the Salary variable. The box plot in Figure 11.16 shows that there are several employees making substantially more in salary than most of the employees. You could consider these outliers and remove them, arguing perhaps that these are senior managers who shouldn’t be included in the analysis. We leave it to you to check whether the regression results are any different with these high-salary employees than without them.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another place to look is at a scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted values. This type of plot shows points with abnormally large residuals. For example, we ran the regression with Female, Years1, the interaction between Female and Years1, and four education dummies, and we obtained the output and scatterplot in Figures 11.17 and 11.18. This scatterplot has several points that could be considered outliers, but we focus on the point identified in the figure. The residual for this point is approximately 223,000. Given that <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> for this regression is approximately 5900, this residual is about four standard errors below zero—quite extreme. If you examine this point more closely, you will see that it corresponds to employee 208, a 62-year-old female employee in the highest job grade. She has 33 years of experience with Fifth National, she has a graduate degree, and she earns only $30,000. She is clearly an unusual employee, and there are probably special circumstances that can explain her small salary, although we can only guess at what they are.<span class="tex-text">\(^{3}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
In any case, if you delete this employee and rerun the regression with the same variables, you will obtain the output in Figure 11.19.<span class="tex-text">\(^{4}\)</span> Now, recalling that gender discrimination is the key issue in this example, you can compare the coefficients of Female and the interaction term in the two outputs. The coefficient of Female has dropped from 4899 to 3774. In words, the Y-intercept for the female regression line used to be about $4900 higher than for the male line; now it is only about $3800 higher. More importantly, the coefficient of the interaction term has changed from -1030 to -858. This coefficient indicates how much less steep the female line for Salary versus Years1 is than the male line. So a change from 21030 to 2858 indicates less discrimination against females now than before. In other words, this unusual female employee accounts for a good bit of the discrimination argument—although a strong argument still exists even without her.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3 StatTools recently added an outlier detection feature. To use it, check the Identify Outliers in Graphs option on the Graphs tab and the Identify Outliers in Data Set option in the the Options tab. For the bank data, it lists employee 208 as an outlier.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 As you can see in cell G3, StatTools identified two new outliers in the reduced data set. This can happen.</p>
