Figure 12.44 illustrates the data setup. Besides the Sales and Time variables, you need to create dummy variables for three of the four quarters. You can then use multiple regression, with Sales as the dependent variable, and Time, Q1, Q2, and Q3 as the explanatory variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The regression output appears in Figure 12.45. Of particular interest are the coefficients of the explanatory variables. The coefficient of Time means that deseasonalized sales increase by about 65.2 per quarter. Also, the coefficients of Q1, Q2, and Q3 mean that sales in quarters 1, 2, and 3 are, respectively, about 260 below, 547 above, and 354 above sales in the reference quarter, quarter 4. This pattern is quite comparable to the pattern of seasonal indexes you saw in previous models for these data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To compare the forecast accuracy of this method to earlier models, you must perform several steps manually. (See Figure 12.46 for reference.) First, calculate the forecasts in column G by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Regression!$B$12+MMULT(Data!C2:F2,Regression!$B$13:$B$16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell G2 and copying it down. (This formula assumes the regression output is in a sheet named Regression. It uses Excel’s MMULT function to sum the products of explanatory values and regression coefficients. Because it is an array formula, you must press Ctrl1Shift1Enter when you enter it. Next, calculate the errors, squared errors, absolute errors, and absolute percentage errors in columns H, I, J, and K, and summarize them in the usual way in column N.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that these summary measures are somewhat larger for this regression model than those from Winters’ method. Still, the corresponding graph in Figure 12.46 shows that the regression method has successfully picked up the trend and the seasonal pattern.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This method of detecting seasonality by using dummy variables in a regression equation is always an option. The other variables included in the regression equation could be time t, lagged versions of <span class="tex-text">\(Y_{t}\)</span>, and/or current or lagged versions of other explanatory variables. These variables would capture any time series behavior other than seasonality. Just remember that there should always be one less dummy variable than the number of seasons. If the data are quarterly, three dummies are needed; if the data are monthly, 11 dummies are needed. If the coefficients of any of these dummies turn out to be statistically insignificant, they can be omitted from the equation. Then the omitted terms are effectively combined with the reference season. For example, if the <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span> term were omitted, then quarters 1 and 4 would essentially be combined and treated as the reference season, and the other two seasons would be compared to them through their dummy variable coefficients.</p>
