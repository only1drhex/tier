            <p class="blog">Javed, a civil engineer, owns and operates a small consulting firm. He invested $5,000 5 years ago in a 6-year CD at 5.5% annual rate, compounded six-monthly. This investment will mature next year. He had planned at the time of investment to purchase a finite element software for design work. But the software company is offering an attractive deal this year. Future updates of the software will be free if purchased this year. He is considering closing the CD and using the proceeds to purchase the software this year, rather than next year as originally planned. There is, however, a penalty for early withdrawal.Not only does he lose the interest for the current (sixth) year, he also foregoes 1% of the total interest earned. How much will he get if he closes the CD, and what is the cost of early withdrawal?</p>

<span class="fontstyle0">The problem statement is slightly lengthy and may be difficult to comprehend. So, let us draw a cashflow diagram with the hope that it would facilitate comprehension.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Based on what we learned in Chapter 2, the cashflow diagram is sketched in Fig. 3.5. Due to the six-monthly compounding, n = 6 </span><span class="fontstyle2">× </span><span class="fontstyle0">2 = 12. For the same reason, </span><span class="fontstyle3">i </span><span class="fontstyle0">= 5.5%/2 = 2.75% per period. As stipulated, the $5,000 investment is due as F at n = 12. But, since Javed is considering to buy the software now (period 10), a year before the CD is due, he will get <span class="tex-text">\( T^{21}\)</span> </span><span class="fontstyle0">. We need to evaluate T and consider the penalties. The first penalty is that he does not get the interest for the sixth year, i.e., for the last two periods. Thus, T must be evaluated for n = 10. Furthermore, he will lose 1% of the interest earned, which is simply the difference between T and the original $5,000 investment.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Again we use the functional notation method. The appropriate formula is Equation (3.6a), wherefrom we have</span></p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(T=5,000\left\lgroup\frac{F}{P},2.75\%,10 \right\rgroup\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Now, we search for the value of the above F/P factor in the tables. Since there is no page for 2.75%, we interpolate the values for 2.5% and 3%. Being exactly in between 2.5% and 3% for which F/P values from the tables are 1.280 and 1.344, the value for 2.75% is the mean of the two; thus,</span></p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left\lgroup\frac{F}{P},2.75\%,10 \right\rgroup =\frac{\left\{\left\lgroup\frac{F}{P} ,2.5\%,10\right\rgroup+\left\lgroup\frac{F}{P},3\%,10 \right\rgroup \right\} }{2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\frac{(1.280+1.344)}{2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=1.312\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(T=5,000\times 1.312\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\$6,560\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Therefore, Javed earns a total interest of </span></p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(I=T-P\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\$6,560-\$5,000\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\$1,560\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">He loses 1% of this, i.e., $15.60 as another penalty. Thus, Javed will get back $6,560 – $15.60 </span><span class="fontstyle2">≈ </span><span class="fontstyle0">$6,544 on closing the account now. This is the first part of the answer.Were the account to run its full course of 6 years, the proceeds would have been F,<br /> where</span></p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(F=5,000\left\lgroup\frac{F}{P} ,2.75\%,12\right\rgroup\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Evaluating the same way, we find</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left\lgroup\frac{F}{P} ,2.75\%,12\right\rgroup =\frac{(1.345+1.426)}{2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=1.3855\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Thus,<br /> </span> <span class="tex-text">\(F=5,000\times 1.3855\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\$6,928\)</span> <p class="blog">

<span class="fontstyle0">Therefore, the cost of early withdrawal</span></p>
