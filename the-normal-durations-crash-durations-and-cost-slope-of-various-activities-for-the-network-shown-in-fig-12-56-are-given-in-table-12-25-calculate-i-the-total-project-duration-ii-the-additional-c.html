The first step is to identify the critical activities and critical path. In order to identify critical activities, we consider normal durations of each of the activities and compute <span class="tex-text">\(T_{E} \text { and } T_{L}\)</span> of events and E.S.T., E.F.T., L.S.T., L.F.T. and total float <span class="tex-text">\(\left(F^{t}\right) \)</span> f each of the activities. The <span class="tex-text">\(T_{E} \text { and } T_{L}\)</span> values of the various events are shown in Fig. 12.57. For each of the activities shown in Fig. 12.57, two time durations are given. The time duration outside the parentheses is the normal time whereas the one given within parentheses is crash time. The E.S.T., E.F.T., L.S.T., L.F.T. and <span class="tex-text">\(F^{t}\)</span> of the various activities of the network shown in Fig. 12.57 are tabulated in Table 12.26.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="530"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="7" width="530">Table 12.26 Normal duration, E.S.T., E.F.T., L.S.T., L.F.T.and <span class="tex-text">\(F^{t}\)</span> of activities</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="81">Activity (i – j)</td> <td width="93">Normal durations (days)</td> <td>E.S.T.

 <p class="blog">
It can be seen from Table 12.26 that activities (1-2), (2-3) and (3-5) are critical activities as their total float is zero. The project completion time is 6 + 9 + 8 = 23 days. On comparing the cost-slope of these critical activities, it is found that critical activity (2–3) has the lowest cost-slope, i.e., ₹ 50 per day, its normal duration is 9 days and crash, i.e., minimum duration is 5 days. It means that the duration of this activity can be reduced by 4 days. So, the project duration can be reduced by 4 days by reducing the time duration of activity (2–3) alone by 4 days. The additional cost of reduction of time duration by 4 days would therefore, be ₹ 50 * 4 = ₹ 200. Now, after reducing the time duration of the critical activity (2–3), the new time duration of the various activities are shown in Fig. 12.58.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Fig. 12.58 shows that no additional activity has become critical. The path 1–2–3–5 still remains the critical path. The project duration now becomes 19 days.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider the case when the project duration has to be reduced by 5 days. No further reduction of time duration is possible from activity (2 3). Comparing the cost-slopes of critical activities (1–2) and (3–5), it is found that critical activity (1–2) has the lowest cost-slope, i.e. ₹ 90 per day. So, the additional cost of reduction of project duration by 5 days would be ₹ 200 + ₹ 90 = ₹ 290.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, after reducing the time duration of activity (1-2) by 1 day, the new time duration of activities are shown in Fig. 12.59. Fig. 12.59 shows that one more activity, i.e., (1-3) has become critical and in addition to path 1–2–3–5, path 1–3–5 has also become critical. The project duration now becomes 18 days.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider the case when the project duration has to be reduced by 6 days. No further reduction of time duration is possible from activities (1–2) and (2–3). Comparing the cost-slopes of critical activities (3–5) and (1–3), it is found that the cost-slope of (1–3) is the lowest, i.e., ₹ 70 per day. If time duration of activity (1–3) alone is reduced by 1 day, then it will not cause a reduction of the project duration by 6 days as the project duration is determined by the path 1–2–3–5, which gives 18 days. Therefore, in order to reduce the project duration by 6 days, it is necessary to reduce the time duration of activity (3–5) by 1 day. Thus, the reduction of project duration by 6 days, is achieved by reducing the time duration of activity (1–2) by 1 day as well as reducing the time duration of activity (3–5) by 1 day. Hence, the additional cost of reducing the project duration by 6 days would be ₹ 290 + ₹ 90 + ₹ 110 = ₹ 490.</p>
