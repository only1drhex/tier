            <p class="blog">Replacement of a Hospital’s Emergency</p> <p class="blog">Electrical Supply System</p> <p class="blog">Sometimes in engineering practice a replacement analysis involves an existing asset that cannot meet future service requirements without augmentation of its capabilities. When this is the case, the defender with increased capability should be competitive with the best available challenger. The analysis of this situation is included in the following case study.</p> <p class="blog">The emergency electrical supply system of a hospital owned by a medical service corporation is presently supported by an <span class="tex-text">\(80-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> diesel-powered electrical generator that was put into service five years ago [capital investment <span class="tex-text">\(=\$ 210,000\)</span>; MACRS (GDS) seven-year property class]. An engineering firm is designing modifications to the electrical and mechanical systems of the hospital as part of an expansion project. The redesigned emergency electrical supply system will require <span class="tex-text">\(120 \mathrm{~kW}\)</span> of generating capacity to serve the increased demand. Two preliminary designs for the system are being considered. The first involves the augmentation of the existing 80-kW generator with a new <span class="tex-text">\(40-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> diesel-powered unit (GDS sevenyear property class). This alternative represents the augmented defender. The second design includes replacement of the existing generator with the best available alternative, a new turbine-powered unit with <span class="tex-text">\(120 \mathrm{~kW}\)</span> of generating capacity (the challenger). Both alternatives will provide the same level of service to the operation of the emergency electrical supply system.</p> <p class="blog">The challenger, if selected, will be leased by the hospital for a 10 -year period. At that time, the lease contract would be renegotiated either for the original piece of equipment or for a replacement generator with the same capacity. The following additional estimates have been generated for use in the replacement analysis.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="743"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="270"></td> <td style="text-align: center;" colspan="3" width="473">Alternative</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td style="text-align: center;" colspan="2">Defender</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>80 kW</td> <td>40 kW</td> <td>Challenger</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Capital investment</td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(\$90,000^{a}\)</span></td> <td>$140,000</td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(\$10,000^{b}\)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Annual lease amount</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>$39,200</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Operating hours per year</td> <td>260</td> <td>260</td> <td>260</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Annual expenses (year zero $):</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Operating and maintenance (O&amp;M)</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>expense per hour</td> <td>$80</td> <td>$35</td> <td>$85</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other expenses</td> <td>$3,200</td> <td>$1,000</td> <td>$2,400</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Useful life</td> <td>10 years</td> <td>15 years</td> <td>15 years</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4" width="743"><span class="tex-text">\({ }^{a} \)</span> Opportunity cost based on present MV of the defender (outsider viewpoint).<br /> <span class="tex-text">\({ }^{b} \)</span> Deposit required by the terms of the contract to lease the challenger.

The after-tax analysis of the first alternative (defender), keeping the existing <span class="tex-text">\(80-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> generator and augmenting its capacity with a new 40-kW generator, is shown in Figure 9-6. The initial <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 230,000\)</span> before-tax capital investment amount (cell B11) is the sum of (1) the present <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 90,000 \mathrm{MV}\)</span> of the existing <span class="tex-text">\(80-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> generator, which is an opportunity cost based on an outsider viewpoint, and (2) the <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 140,000\)</span> capital investment for the new <span class="tex-text">\(40-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> generator. The <span class="tex-text">\(-\$ 43,145\)</span> of taxable income at time zero (cell E11) is because of the gain on disposal, which is not incurred when the <span class="tex-text">\(80-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> generator is kept instead of sold. The after-tax <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}\)</span> of keeping the defender and augmenting its capacity is <span class="tex-text">\(-\$ 282,472\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A spreadsheet analysis of the leasing alternative (challenger) is shown in Figure 9-7. Under the contract terms for leasing the challenger, there is an initial <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 10,000\)</span> deposit, which is fully refundable at the end of the 10 -year period. There are no tax consequences associated with the deposit transaction. The annual beforetax cash flow (BTCF) for the challenger is the sum of (1) the annual lease amount, which stays constant over the 10-year contract period, and (2) the annual operating and maintenance and other expenses, which increase at the rate of <span class="tex-text">\(4 \%\)</span> per year. For example, the BTCF for the challenger in year one is <span class="tex-text">\(-\$ 39,200-[\$ 85(260)+\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 2,400](1.04)=-\$ 64,680\)</span>. These annual BTCF amounts for years one through ten are fully deductible from taxable income by the corporation, and they are also the taxable income amounts for the alternative (the corporation cannot claim any depreciation on the challenger because it does not own the equipment). Hence, the after-tax PW of selecting the challenger, assuming it is leased under these contract terms, is <span class="tex-text">\(-\$ 239,695\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Based on an after-tax analysis, the challenger or a new turbine-powered unit with <span class="tex-text">\(120 \mathrm{~kW}\)</span> of generating capacity is economically preferable for use in the emergency electrical supply system because its PW has the least negative value. This case study also illustrates the importance of a life cycle costing (LCC) approach to the economic evaluation of engineering alternatives. In the foregoing case, not only is the initial capital investment considered but annual operating and maintenance costs for each alternative as well. Leasing the <span class="tex-text">\(120-\mathrm{kW}\)</span> generator over a 10-year period is economically preferable to the other alternatives in this case.</p>
