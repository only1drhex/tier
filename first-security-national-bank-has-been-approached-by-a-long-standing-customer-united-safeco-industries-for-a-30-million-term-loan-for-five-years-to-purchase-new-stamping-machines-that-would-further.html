            <p class="blog">First Security National Bank has been approached by a long-standing customer, United Safeco Industries, for a $30 million term loan for five years to purchase new stamping machines that would further automate the company’s assembly line in the manufacture of metal toys and containers. The company also plans to use at least half the loan proceeds to facilitate its buyout of Calem Corp., which imports and partially assembles video recorders and cameras. Additional funds for the buyout will come from a corporate bond issue that will be underwritten by an investment banking firm not affiliated with First Security.</p> <p class="blog">The problem the bank’s commercial credit division faces in assessing this customer’s loan request is a management decision reached several weeks ago that the bank should gradually work down its leverage buyout loan portfolio due to a significant rise in nonperforming credits. Moreover, the prospect of sharply higher interest rates has caused the bank to revamp its loan policy toward more short term loans (under one year) and fewer term (over one year) loans. Senior management has indicated it will no longer approve loans that require a commitment of the bank’s resources beyond a term of three years, except in special cases.</p> <p class="blog">Does First Security have any service option in the form of off-balance-sheet instruments that could help this customer while avoiding committing $30 million in reserves for a five-year loan? What would you recommend that management do to keep United Safeco happy with its current banking relationship? Could First Security earn any fee income if it pursued your idea?</p> <p class="blog">Suppose the current interest rate on Eurodollar deposits (three-month maturities) in London is 3.40 percent, while Federal funds and six-month CDs are trading in the United States at 3.57 percent and 3.19 percent, respectively. Term loans to comparable quality corporate borrowers are trading at one-eighth to one-quarter percentage point above the three-month Eurodollar rate or one-quarter to one-half point over the secondary-market CD rate. Is there a way First Security could earn at least as much fee income by providing United Safeco with support services as it could from making the loan the company has asked for (after all loan costs are taken into account)? Please explain how the customer could benefit even if the bank does not make the loan requested.</p>

In view of these reasonable objectives on the part of First Security National Bank’s management, the bank should consider recommending that the leveraged buy-out portion of the request be handled by an offering of bonds or, perhaps, 5-year notes, with the bank issuing a standby letter of credit for a portion (though probably not all) of the bond or note issue. Armed with First Security’s standby credit agreement, United Safeco should be able to borrow through a security issue at a substantially lower interest rate. First Security could sell participations in the standby credit to share its risk exposure.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the portion of the loan that calls for the purchase of new assembly-line equipment, management might seriously consider proposing a shorter-term loan for about one-third to one-half the total amount requested by Safeco. This loan would be secured by a pledge of the new equipment plus sufficient covenants to insure the maintenance of adequate liquidity and require bank approval before significant amounts of other forms of debt are undertaken.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First Security could generate fee income from this relationship by assessing a fee for issuing the standby letter of credit. The fee for a standby letter of credit typically ranges from ½ percent to 1 percent of the amount of the standby guarantee, depending upon the bank’s assessment of the degree of risk exposure in the guarantee.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If First Security issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of United Safeco as described above, both parties should benefit. First Security, by issuing the standby credit agreement, does not have to tie up $30 million in reserves for an extended period of time as it would if it made the requested loan, particularly in a projected rising interest rate environment. The ½ percent to 1 percent fee would compare favorably in amount to the 1/8 to ¼ percent spread over the Eurodollar rate or the ¼ to ½ percent spread over the federal funds or CD rate that currently prevails in the market. Under the risk-based capital standards now in effect, the standby letter of credit will require the bank to hold capital in an amount equal to the capital requirement for the loan. Therefore, United Security National will have the same capital requirement for either transaction, the loan or the standby letter of credit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Also, as stated above, United Safeco should be able to issue bonds or notes at a more favorable rate with United Security National’s standby letter of credit behind them.</p>
