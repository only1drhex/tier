The variables and constraints for this model appear in Figure 14.67. (See the file Portfolio Selection Big Picture.xlsx.) One interesting aspect of this model is that it is not necessary to specify the amount of money invested—it could be $100, $1000, $1,000,000, or any other amount. The model determines the fractions of this amount to invest in the various stocks, and these fractions are relevant for any investment amount. The only requirement is that the fractions should sum to 1, so that all of the money is invested. Besides this, the fractions are constrained to be nonnegative to prevent shorting stocks.<span class="tex-text">\(^{20}\)</span> Finally, the expected portfolio return is constrained to be at least as large as a specified expected return, such as 12%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The individual steps are now listed. (See Figure 14.68 and the file Portfolio Selection Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the input cells. These include the estimates of means, standard deviations, and correlations, as well as the required expected return.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Fractions invested. Enter any trial values in the Investment_weights range for the fractions of Perlman’s money placed in the three investments. Then sum these with the SUM function in cell B19.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Expected annual return. Use Equation (14.7) to calculate the expected annual return in cell B23 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { Expected value of } R_{p}=\mu_{1} x_{1}+\mu_{2} x_{2}+\cdots+\mu_{n} x_{n}\)</span> (14.7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B5:D5,Investment_weights)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Covariance matrix. Equation (14.9) is used to calculate the portfolio variance. To do this, you must first calculate a matrix of covariances. Using the general formula for covariance, <span class="tex-text">\(C_{i j}=r_{i j} s_{i} s_{j}\)</span> (which holds even when i = j, because <span class="tex-text">\(r_{i i}=1\)</span>), these can be calculated from the inputs by using lookups. Specifically, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { Estimated variance of } R_{p}=\sum_{i, j} c_{i j} x_{i} x_{j}\)</span> (14.9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=HLOOKUP($F9,$B$4:$D$6,3)*B9*HLOOKUP(G$8,$B$4:$D$6,3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell G9, and copy it to the range G9:I11. (B9 captures the relevant correlation. The two HLOOKUP terms capture the appropriate standard deviations.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Portfolio variance. Although the mathematical details are not presented here, it can be shown that the summation in Equation (14.9) is the product of three matrices: a row of fractions invested multiplied by the covariance matrix multiplied by a column of fractions invested. To calculate it, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MMULT(Investment_weights,MMULT(G9:I11,TRANSPOSE(Investment_weights)))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B25 and press Ctrl1Shift1Enter. (Remember that Excel puts curly brackets around this formula. You should not type these curly brackets.) This formula uses two MMULT functions. Again, this is because MMULT can multiply only two matrices at a time. The formula first multiplies the last two matrices and then multiplies this product by the first matrix.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Portfolio standard deviation. Most financial analysts talk in terms of portfolio variance. However, it is probably more intuitive to talk about portfolio standard deviation because it is in the same units as the returns. Calculate the standard deviation in cell B26 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SQRT(Portfolio_variance)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Actually, either cell B25 or B26 can be used as the objective cell to minimize. Minimizing the square root of a function is equivalent to minimizing the function itself.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The completed Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 14.69. The constraints specify that the expected return must be at least as large as the minimal required expected return, and all the company’s money must be invested. The decision variable cells are constrained to be nonnegative (to avoid short selling), and because of the squared terms in the variance formula, you must select the GRG Nonlinear method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The solution in Figure 14.68 indicates that the company should put half of its money in each of stocks 1 and 3, and it should not invest in stock 2 at all. This might be somewhat surprising, given that the ranking of riskiness of the stocks is 1, 2, 3, with stock 1 being the most risky but also having the highest expected return. However, the correlations play an important role in portfolio selection, so you can usually not guess the optimal portfolio on the basis of the means and standard deviations alone.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The portfolio standard deviation of 0.1217 can be interpreted in a probabilistic sense. If stock returns are approximately normally distributed, the actual portfolio return will be within one standard deviation of the expected return with probability about 0.68, and the actual portfolio return will be within two standard deviations of the expected return with probability about 0.95. Given that the expected return is 12%, this implies a lot of risk—two standard deviations below this mean is a negative return (or loss) of slightly more than 12%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The constraints for this model are linear, and it can be shown that the portfolio variance is a convex function of the investment fractions. This is sufficient to guarantee that the Solver solution is indeed optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
This model begs for a sensitivity analysis on the minimum required return. When the company requires a larger expected return, it must assume a larger risk. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 14.70, where SolverTable has been used with cell D23 as the single input cell, varied from 0.10 to 0.14 in increments of 0.005. Note that values outside this range are of little interest. Stock 3 has the minimum expected return, 0.10, and stock 1 has the highest expected return, 0.14, so no portfolio can have an expected return outside of this range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results indicate that the company should put more and more into risky stock 1 as the required return increases—and stock 2 continues to be unused. The accompanying scatter chart (with the option to “connect the dots”) shows the risk–return trade-off. As the company assumes more risk, as measured by portfolio standard deviation, the expected return increases, but at a decreasing rate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The curve in this chart is called the efficient frontier. Points on the efficient frontier can be achieved by appropriate portfolios. Points below the efficient frontier can be achieved, but they are not as good as points on the efficient frontier because they have a lower expected return for a given level of risk. In contrast, points above the efficient frontier are unachievable—the company cannot achieve this high an expected return for a given level of risk.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Typical real-world portfolio selection problems involve a large number of potential investments, certainly many more than three. This admittedly requires more input data, particularly for the correlation matrix, but the basic model does not change at all. In particular, the matrix formula for portfolio variance is exactly the same. This shows the power of using Excel’s matrix functions. Without them, the formula for portfolio variance would be a long, involved sum.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• If Perlman is allowed to short a stock, the fraction invested in that stock is allowed to be negative. To implement this, you can eliminate the nonnegativity constraints on the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• An alternative objective might be to minimize the probability that the portfolio loses money. This possibility is illustrated in one of the problems.</p>
 <p class="blog">
20 If you want to allow shorting, do not check the Non-Negative option in the Solver dialog box.</p>
