Today, this five-week loan is due, and Robin is asking for renewal at money market borrowing cost plus one-fourth of a point. You must assess whether the finance company did as well on this account using the Federal funds rate as the index of borrowing cost as it would have done by quoting Robin the prevailing CD rate, the commercial paper rate, the Eurodollar deposit rate or possibly the prevailing rate on U.S. Treasury bills plus a small margin for risk and probability. To assess what would have happened (and might happen over the next five weeks if the loan is renewed at a small margin over any of the money market rates listed above), you have assembled these data from the Federal Reserve Statistical Releases H15</p>

Robin Corporation was quoted a loan rate equal to the prevailing federal funds interest rate plus 3/8 of a percentage point (or 0.375%). Robin wanted the loan renewed at money-market borrowing cost plus 0.25%. If the base rate is set at the federal funds rate the loan rate as requested by Robin would be:</p>

Clearly the other money-market interest rates would have generated somewhat lower loan rates, especially the CP and Treasury bill rates. However, interest rates fell over the period examined, resulting in lower loan revenues for the bank. The bank would have been better off to offer its customer a fixed interest rate over the next five weeks.</p>
