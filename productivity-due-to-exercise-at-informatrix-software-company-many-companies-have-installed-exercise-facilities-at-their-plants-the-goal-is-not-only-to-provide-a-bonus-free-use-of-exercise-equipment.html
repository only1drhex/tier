            <p class="blog"><strong>PRODUCTIVITY DUE TO EXERCISE AT INFORMATRIX SOFTWARE COMPANY</strong></p> <p class="blog">Many companies have installed exercise facilities at their plants. The goal is not only to provide a bonus (free use of exercise equipment) for their employees, but to make the employees more productive by getting them in better shape.One such (fictional) company, Informatrix Software Company, installed exercise equipment on site a year ago. To check whether it has had a beneficial effect on employee productivity, the company gathered data on a sample of 80 randomly chosen employees, all between the ages of 30 and 40 and all with similar job titles and duties. The company observed which of these employees use the exercise facility regularly (at least three times per week on average). This group included 23 of the 80 employees in the sample. The other 57 employees were asked whether they exercise regularly elsewhere, and 6 of them replied that they do. The remaining 51, who admitted to being nonexercisers, were then compared to the combined group of 29 exercisers.</p> <p class="blog">The comparison was based on the employees’ productivity over the year, as rated by their supervisors. Each rating was on a scale of 1 to 25, 25 being the best. To increase the validity of the study, neither the employees nor the supervisors were told that a study was in progress. In particular, the supervisors did not know which employees were involved in the study or which were exercisers. The data from the study are listed in the file Exercise &amp; Productivity.xlsx. It includes a Yes/No column on whether the person is an exerciser and a column of ratings. Do these data support the company’s (alternative) hypothesis that exercisers outperform nonexercisers on average? Can the company infer that any difference between the two groups is due to exercise?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use a two-sample t test for the difference between means to see whether regular exercise increases worker productivity.</p>

To see whether there is any indication of a difference between the two groups, a good first step is to create side-by-side box plots of the Rating variable. These appear in Figure 9.10.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Side-by-side box plots are typically a good way to begin the analysis when comparing two populations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although there is a great deal of overlap between the two distributions,the distribution for the exercisers is somewhat higher than that for the nonexercisers. Also, the variances of the two distributions appear to be roughly the same, although there is slightly more variation in the nonexerciser distribution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A formal test of the mean difference uses the hypotheses <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2} \leq 0 \text { versus } H_{ a }: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2}&gt;0 \text {, where } \mu_{1} \text { and } \mu_{2}\)</span> are the mean ratings for the exerciser and nonexerciser populations. It makes sense to use a one-tailed test, with the alternative of the “greater than” variety, because the company expects higher ratings, on average, for the exercisers. The output for this test appears in Figure 9.10. The calculations were performed by the HT Mean Diff sheet from the template file. If you compare these formulas to the two-sample confidence interval formulas in the previous chapter, you will see that they are very similar. Again, array formulas are used for the sample standard deviations (because Excel has no STDEVIF function), a test for equality of the two variances is shown in the bottom section, and the standard error of the difference and the degrees of freedom depend on the p-value of this test for equal variances.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The output shows that the observed sample mean difference, 2.725, is indeed positive. That is, the exercisers in the sample outperformed the nonexercisers by 2.725 rating points on average. The output also shows that (1) the standard error of the sample mean difference is 1.142, (2) the test statistic is 2.387, and (3) the p-value for a one-tailed test is slightly less than 0.01. In words, the data provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level, as well as at the 5% and 10% levels. It is clear that exercisers perform better, in terms of mean ratings, than nonexercisers. A 95% confidence interval for this mean difference (not shown) is all negative; it extends from 24.988 to -0.452.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This answers the first question we posed, but it doesn’t answer the second. There is no way to be sure that the higher ratings for the exercisers are a direct result of exercise. It is possible that employees who exercise are naturally more ambitious and hard-working people, and that this extra drive is responsible for both their exercising and their higher ratings. This study is an observational study. The company observes two randomly selected groups of employees and analyzes the results. It does not explicitly control for other factors, such as personality, that might be responsible for differences in ratings. Therefore, the company can never be sure that there is a causal relationship between exercise and performance ratings. All the company can state is that exercisers appear, on average, to be more productive than nonexercisers—for whatever reason.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The test reported at the bottom of Figure 9.11 is a formal test of the hypothesis <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0}: \sigma_{1}^{2} / \sigma_{2}^{2}=1 \text { versus } H_{a}: \sigma_{1}^{2} / \sigma_{2}^{2} \neq 1\)</span>, where the parameter being tested is the ratio of the two population variances. (The details behind this test are explained in the following subsection.) If this null hypothesis can be rejected on the basis of a low p-value in cell B22, then the equal-variance assumption is almost certainly not valid, and the procedure that does not assume equal variances is used. The p-value in cell B11, 0.145, suggests that the evidence against equal population variances is far from overwhelming, so it is safe to use equal-variance procedure for this example.</p>
