            <p class="blog">A 3-mm-thick panel of aluminum alloy (k = 177 W/m. K, c = 875 J/kg . K, and ρ = 2770 kg/m³ ) is finished on both sides with an epoxy coating that must be cured at or above <span class="tex-text">\(T_{c}\)</span> = 150 °C for at least 5 min. The production line for the curing operation involves two steps: (1) heating in a large oven with air at <span class="tex-text">\(T_{∞,o}\)</span>= 175 °C and a convection coefficient of <span class="tex-text">\(h_{o} = 40 W/m^{2} .

The heating portion of the process is conducted over a time interval <span class="tex-text">\(t_{e}\)</span>, which exceeds the time <span class="tex-text">\(t_{c}\)</span> required to reach 150 °C by 5 min (<span class="tex-text">\(t_{e} = t_{c}\)</span> +300 s). The coating has an emissivity of ε = 0.8, and the temperatures of the oven and chamber walls are 175 and 25 °C, respectively. If the panel is placed in the oven at an initial temperature of 25 °C and removed from the chamber at a safe-to-touch tempera-ture of 37 °C, what is the total elapsed time for the two-step curing operation?</p>

Known: Operating conditions for a two-step heating/cooling process in which a coated aluminum panel is maintained at or above a temperature of 150 °C for at least 5 min.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Find: Total time <span class="tex-text">\(t_t\)</span> required for the two-step process.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assumptions:<br /> 1. Panel temperature is uniform at any instant.<br /> 2. Thermal resistance of epoxy is negligible.<br /> 3. Constant properties.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysis: To assess the validity of the lumped capacitance approximation, we begin by calculating Biot numbers for the heating and cooling processes.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Bi_{h} = \frac{h_{0} L }{k} = \frac{(40 W/m^{2} . K)(0.0015 m)}{177 W/m . K} = 3.4 \times 10^{-4}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Bi_{c} = \frac{h_{c} L }{k} = \frac{(10 W/m^{2} . K)(0.0015 m)}{177 W/m . K} = 8.5 \times 10^{-5} \)</span> <p class="blog">
Hence the lumped capacitance approximation is excellent. To determine whether radiation exchange between the panel and its surroundings should be considered, the radiation heat transfer coefficient is determined from Equation 1.9 <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r} \equiv \varepsilon \sigma (T_{s} +T_{sur}) (T^{2}_{s} +T^{2}_{sur})\)</span>. A representative value of hr for the heating process is associated with the cure condi-tion, in which case</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r,0} = \varepsilon \sigma (T_{c} +T_{sur,0}) (T^{2}_{c} +T^{2}_{sur,0}) = 0.8 × 5.67 × 10^{-8} W/m^{2} . K^{4}(423 +448)K(423^{2} + 448^{2})K^{2} = 15 W/m^{2} . K\)</span> <p class="blog">
Using <span class="tex-text">\(T_{c} \)</span>= 150 °C with <span class="tex-text">\(T_{sur,c}\)</span> = 25 °C for the cooling process, we also obtain <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r,c} =8.8 W/m^{2} . K\)</span> . Since the values of <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r,o}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r,c}\)</span> are comparable to those of <span class="tex-text">\(h_{o}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(h_{c}\)</span>, respec-tively, radiation effects must be considered .</p>
 <p class="blog">
With <span class="tex-text">\(V = 2LA_{s}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(A_{s,c} = A_{s,r} = 2A_{s}\)</span>, Equation 5.15 <span class="tex-text">\( As(c,r)=\rho V c\frac{dT}{dt} \)</span> ]may be expressed as</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( -\left[ h (T-T_{\infty })+ \varepsilon \sigma (T^{4}-T^{4}_{sur})\right] =\rho c L\frac{dT}{dt} \)</span> <p class="blog">
Selecting a suitable time increment, Δt, the equation may be integrated numerically to obtain the panel temperature at t = Δt, 2Δt, 3Δt, and so on. Selecting Δt = 10 s, calcula-tions for the heating process are extended to <span class="tex-text">\(t_{e} = t_{c} + 300 s\)</span>, which is 5 min beyond the time required for the panel to reach <span class="tex-text">\(T_{c}\)</span> = 150 °C. At te the cooling process is initiated and continued until the panel temperature reaches 37 °C at <span class="tex-text">\(t = t_{t}\)</span>. The integration was performed using IHT, and results of the calculations are plotted as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total time for the two-step process is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(t_{t}= 989 s\)</span> <p class="blog">
with intermediate times of <span class="tex-text">\(t_{c} \)</span>= 124 s and <span class="tex-text">\(t_{e}\)</span> = 424 s.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comments:<br /> 1. The duration of the two-step process may be reduced by increasing the convection coefficients and/or by reducing the period of extended heating. The second option is made possible by the fact that, during a portion of the cooling period, the panel temperature remains above 150 °C. Hence, to satisfy the cure requirement, it is not necessary to extend heating for as much as 5 min from <span class="tex-text">\(t = t_{c}\)</span>. If the convection coefficients are increased to <span class="tex-text">\(h_{o} = h_{c} = 100 W/m^{2} . K\)</span> and an extended heating period of 300 s is maintained, the numerical integration yields <span class="tex-text">\(t_{c}\)</span> = 58 s and <span class="tex-text">\(t_{t}\)</span> = 445 s. The corresponding time interval over which the panel temperature exceeds 150 °C is <span class="tex-text">\(Δt_{(T &gt;150 °C)}\)</span> = 306 s (58 s ≤ t ≤ 364 s). If the extended heating period is reduced to 294 s, the numerical integration yields <span class="tex-text">\(t_{c} = 58 s, t_{t} = 439 s\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(Δt_{(T &gt;150 °C)}\)</span>= 300 s. Hence the total process time is reduced, while the curing requirement is still satisfied.<br /> 2. Generally, the accuracy of a numerical integration improves with decreasing Δt, but at the expense of increased computation time. In this case, however, results obtained for Δt = 1 s are virtually identical to those obtained for Δt = 10 s, indicating that the larger time interval is sufficient to accurately depict the temperature history.<br /> 3. The complete solution for this example is provided as a ready-to-solve model in the Advanced section of IHT, using Models, Lumped Capacitance. The model can be used to check the results of Comment 1 or to independently explore modifications of the cure process.<br /> 4. If the Biot numbers were not small, it would be inappropriate to apply the lumped capac-itance method. For moderate or large Biot numbers, temperatures near the solid’s center-line would continue to increase for some time after the conclusion of heating, as thermal energy near the solid’s surface propagates inward. The temperatures near the centerline would subsequently reach a maximum and would then decrease to the steady-state value. Correlations for the maximum temperature experienced at the panel’s centerline, along with the time at which these maximum temperatures are reached, have been correlated for a broad range of <span class="tex-text">\(Bi_{h}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Bi_{c}\)</span> values [1].</p>
