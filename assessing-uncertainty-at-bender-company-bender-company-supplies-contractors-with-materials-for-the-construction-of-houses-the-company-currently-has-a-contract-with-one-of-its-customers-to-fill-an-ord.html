The company currently has a contract with one of its customers to fill an order by the end of July. However, there is some uncertainty about whether this deadline can be met, due to uncertainty about whether Bender will receive the materials it needs from one of its suppliers by the middle of July.

Let A be the event that Bender meets its end-of-July deadline, and let B be the event that Bender receives the materials from its supplier by the middle of July. The probabilities Bender is best able to assess on July 1 are probably <span class="tex-text">\(P(B) \text { and } P(A \mid B)\)</span>. At the beginning of July, Bender might estimate that the chances of getting the materials on time from its supplier are 2 out of 3, so that <span class="tex-text">\(P(B)=2 / 3\)</span>. Also, thinking ahead, Bender estimates that if it receives the required materials on time, the chances of meeting the end-of-July deadline are 3 out of 4. This is a conditional probability statement that <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \mid B)=3 / 4\)</span>. Then the multiplication<br /> rule implies that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \text { and } B)=P(A \mid B) P(B)=(3 / 4)(2 / 3)=0.5\)</span> <p class="blog">
That is, there is a fifty–fifty chance that Bender will get its materials on time and meet its end-of July deadline.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This uncertain situation is depicted graphically in the form of a probability tree in Figure 5.2. Note that Bender initially faces (at the leftmost branch of the tree) the uncertainty of whether event B or its complement will occur. Regardless of whether event B occurs, Bender must next confront the uncertainty regarding event A. This uncertainty is reflected in the set of two pairs of branches in the right half of the tree. Hence, there are four mutually exclusive outcomes regarding the two uncertain events, as listed to the right of the tree. Initially, Bender is interested in the first possible outcome, the joint occurrence of events A and B, the top probability in the figure. Another way to compute this probability is to multiply the probabilities associated with the branches leading to this outcome, that is, the probability of B times the probability of A given B. As the figure indicates, this is <span class="tex-text">\((3 / 4)(2 / 3) \text {, or } 0.5\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are several other probabilities of interest in this example. First, let <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{B}\)</span> be the complement of B; it is the event that the materials from the supplier do not arrive on time. We know that <span class="tex-text">\(P(\bar{B})=1-P(B)=1 / 3\)</span> from the rule of complements. However, we do not yet know the conditional probability <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \mid \bar{B})\)</span>, the probability that Bender will meet its end-of-July deadline, given that it does not receive the materials from the supplier on time. In particular, <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \mid \bar{B}) \text { is not equal to } 1-P(A \mid B)\)</span>. (Can you see why?) Suppose Bender estimates that the chances of meeting the end-of-July deadline are 1 out of 5 if the materials do not arrive on time, so that <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \mid \bar{B})=1 / 5\)</span>. Then a second use of the multiplication rule gives</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \text { and } \bar{B})=P(A \mid \bar{B}) P(\bar{B})=(1 / 5)(1 / 3)=0.0667\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
In words, there is only 1 chance out of 15 that the materials will not arrive on time and Bender will meet its end-of-July deadline. This is the third (from the top) probability listed at the right of the tree.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The bottom line for Bender is whether it will meet its end-of-July deadline. After mid-July, this probability is either <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \mid B)=3 / 4 \text { or } P(A \mid \bar{B})=1 / 5\)</span> because by this time, Bender will know whether the materials arrived on time. But on July 1, the relevant probability is P(A)—there is still uncertainty about whether <span class="tex-text">\(B \text { or } \bar{B}\)</span> will occur. Fortunately, you can calculate P(A) from the probabilities you already know. The logic is that A consists of the two mutually exclusive events (A and B) and <span class="tex-text">\((A \text { and } \bar{B})\)</span>. That is, if A is to occur, it must occur with B or with <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{B}\)</span>. Therefore, the addition rule for mutually exclusive events implies that</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P(A)=P(A \text { and } B)+P(A \text { and } \bar{B})=1 / 2+1 / 15=17 / 30=0.5667\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The chances are 17 out of 30 that Bender will meet its end-of-July deadline, given the information it has at the beginning of July.</p>
