We want to cluster customers, not transactions, so we need to transform the data set in Figure 17.29, where each row is a transaction, to a data set where each row is a customer. This can be done with COUNTIFS and SUMIFS functions (or with pivottables), as shown in Figure 17.30. We have done this two ways, and either can be the basis for a cluster analysis. Both of these tables have 250 rows, one for each customer. The table on the left shows counts of transactions, broken down by shoe type. Its typical formula, in cell B3, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=COUNTIFS(Data!$B$2:$B$3001, $A3, Data!$C$2:$C$3001, B$2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The table on the right shows sums of amount spent, again broken down by shoe type. Its typical formula, in cell 13, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMIFS(Data!$D$2:$D$3001, Data!$B$2:$B$3001, $A3, Data!$C$2:$C$3001, I$2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The finished version of the file shows two cluster analyses, one based on each of these tables. We will focus only on the transaction counts here, but both cluster analyses lead to similar results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The counts in the first table are then copied to another sheet, shown in Figure 17.31. Each row corresponds to a customer, and each column from B to F represents an “attribute” for the cluster analysis. Typically, the attribute columns can be of very different magnitudes (although this isn’t the case here), so it is again useful to standardize them in some way. For illustration, we have expressed each as a percentage of the maximum value in its column. These percentages appear in columns G to K. This isn’t the only way to standardize, but it has the attractive property that each standardized value is between 0 and 1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next we perform the K-Means procedure, shown in Figure 17.32. We have somewhat arbitrarily chosen K = 4, so that four clusters will be used. (We ask you in the problems to rerun the analysis with other values of K.) We need four cluster centers, listed in columns T to X. Each cluster center is a set of attribute values, and because of the way we standardized, each of these attribute values should be between 0 and 1. Any values can be used initially; Solver will eventually be used to find the “best” cluster centers. (Again, this contrasts with the previous example, where we required each cluster center to be one of the existing 49 cities.) For any given cluster centers, we find the “distance” from each customer’s standardized attributes to each cluster center. Various distance measures are used in cluster analysis, but we will again use the popular Euclidean (straight-line) distance measure: the square root of the sum of squared differences. There are several ways to implement this in Excel, but we have used a combination of the SUMXMY2 (sum of squared X minus Y values) and the OFFSET function. The formula in cell L4, which can be copied down and across, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SQRT(SUMXMY2($G4:$K4,OFFSET($T$2,L$3,0,1,5)))</p>
 <p class="blog">
The range G4:K4 contains the standardized attributes for this particular customer, and the OFFSET function uses the indexes in row 3 to return the attributes for the appropriate cluster center. Then each customer is assigned to the cluster with the minimum distance. The formulas in cells P4 and Q4 are</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MIN(L4:04)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MATCH(P4,L4:O4,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total distance over all customers in cell T8, the sum of the values in column P, is then the objective to be minimized. The Solver setup appears in Figure 17.33. The decision variable cells are the cluster centers, and they are constrained to be between 0 and 1. We have again used the Evolutionary method instead of the GRG Nonlinear method. This is a highly nonlinear (and nonsmooth) problem, and the Evolutionary method is more reliable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The last step is to make sense of the clusters. To do this, it is useful to return to the transaction data, but with cluster IDs attached. This is shown in Figure 17.34. (Each cluster ID in column E is based on a lookup of the CustID in the table in Figures 17.31 and 17.32.) Then a table of transaction counts and an associated chart can be created, as shown in Figure 17.35. Each value in the table represents the number of transactions for a given shoe type made by customers in a given cluster. The typical formula, in cell B3, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMIF(‘Cluster by Count’!$Q$4:$Q$253,$A3,‘Cluster by Count’!B$4:B$253)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(Again, these counts could be found more easily with pivot tables.)<br /> It is particularly useful to use a chart of the stacked column type, where each piece of each column represents that cluster’s percentage of all transactions made by that cluster. As described in the text box, the “meaning” of the clusters is then quite apparent. The shoe company could assign other customers (that is, other than these 250) to the given clusters, based on their past buying behavior. Then it could devise specific promotions for each cluster and target market to customers based on their cluster membership.</p>
