Clearly, there is no need to include both Right and Left in an equation for Height—either one of them suffices—but we include them both to make a point. It is likely that there is a large correlation between height and foot size, so you would expect this regression equation to do a good job. For example, the <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> value will probably be large. But what about the coefficients of Right and Left? Here there is a problem. The coefficient of Right indicates the right foot’s effect on Height in addition to the effect of the left foot. This additional effect is probably minimal. That is, after the effect of Left on Height has been taken into account, the extra information provided by Right is probably minimal. But it goes the other way also. The extra effect of Left, in addition to that provided by Right, is probably also minimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To show what can happen numerically, we used simulation to generate a hypothetical data set of heights and left and right foot lengths. We did this so that, except for random error, height is approximately 31.8 plus 3.2 times foot length (all expressed in inches). (See Figure 11.4 and the file Heights Simulation Finished.xlsx. You can check the formulas in columns A–D (and read the explanation in the file) to see how we generated the data with the desired properties. The correlation between Height and either Right or Left is quite large, and the correlation between Right and Left is very close to 1 (see cells G7 to G9).</p>
 <p class="blog">
We copied the data to three separate sheets, each time pasting as values, and we ran a regression of Height versus Right and Left on each of these sheets. (The pasted data on each sheet are different because of random numbers.) The outputs tell a somewhat confusing story. The multiple R and the corresponding <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> are about as expected, given the correlations between Height and either Right or Left. In particular, the multiple R is close to the correlation between Height and either Right or Left. Also, the <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> value is quite small, about 3.0. It implies that predictions of height from this regression equation will typically be off by only about three inches.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Multicollinearity often causes regression coefficients to have the “wrong” sign, t-values to be too small, and p-values to be too large.</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, the coefficients of Right and Left are not at all what you might expect, given that the heights were generated as approximately 31.8 plus 3.2 times foot length. On the first regression they are 2.898 and 0.455; on the second (shown in Figure 11.5) they are 20.873 and 4.102; and on the third they are 1.018 and 2.189. This is what can happen when multicollinearity is present. The coefficients can vary wildly from one sample to the next, and a coefficient can even have the “wrong” sign. (All correlations are positive, so no coefficients should be negative.) Also, it is impossible to predict which, if any, of the coefficients will be statistically significant.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The problem is that although both Right and Left are clearly related to Height, it is impossible for the least squares method to distinguish their separate effects. However, note that the sum of the coefficients in each of the regression equations is approximately 3.2, the value that was used to generate the data. This means that each estimated equation will work well for predicting heights, in spite of not producing reliable estimates of the individual coefficients of Right and Left.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Multicollinearity typically causes unreliable estimates of regression coefficients, but it does not generally cause poor predictions.</p>
