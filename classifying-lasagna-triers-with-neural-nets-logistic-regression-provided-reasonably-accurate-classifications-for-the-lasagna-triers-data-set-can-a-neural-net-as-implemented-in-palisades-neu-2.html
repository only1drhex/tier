The data for this version of the example are in the file Lasagna Triers NeuralTools.xlsx. There are two differences from the file used for logistic regression. First, no dummy variables are necessary. The NeuralTools add-in is capable of dealing directly with text variables. Second, there is a Prediction Data sheet with a second data set of size 250 to be used for prediction. Its values of the dependent Have Tried variable are unknown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You launch NeuralTools just like StatTools, @RISK, or any of the other Palisade add ins. This produces a NeuralTools tab and ribbon, as shown in Figure 17.8. As you can see, NeuralTools uses a Data Set Manager, just like StatTools. The only difference is that when you specify the data set, you must indicate the role of each variable in the neural net. The possible roles are Independent Numeric, Independent Categorical, Dependent Numeric, Dependent Categorical, Tag, and Unused. Except for Tag, which isn’t used here, these have the obvious meanings. So the first step is to create two data sets, one foreach sheet, with Have Tried as Dependent Categorical, Person as Unused, and the other variables as Independent Numeric or Independent Categorical as appropriate. (NeuralTools usually guesses the roles correctly.) We call these data sets Train/Test Data and Prediction Data, respectively.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To train the data in the Train/Test Data set, you activate the Data sheet and click Train on the NeuralTools ribbon to get a Training dialog box with three tabs. The Train tab shown in Figure 17.9 provides three basic options. The first option allows you to partition the data set into training and testing subsets. The default shown here is to set aside a random 20% of cases for testing. The second option is for predicting cases with missing values of the dependent variable. This is not relevant here because there are no such cases in the Data sheet. Besides, prediction will be performed later on the Prediction Data set. The third option is to calculate variable impacts. This is useful when you have a large number of potential explanatory variables. It lets you screen out the ones that appear to be least useful. You can check this option if you like. However, its output doesn’t tell you, at least not directly, how the different explanatory variables affect the dependent variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Net Configuration tab shown in Figure 17.10 lets you select one of three options for the training algorithm. The PN/GRN (probabilistic neural net) algorithm is relatively new. It is fairly quick and it usually gives good results, so it is a good option to try, as is done here.<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span> The MLF option (multilayer feedforward) algorithm is more traditional, but it is considerably slower. The Best Net Search tries both PN/GRN and various versions of MLF to see which is best, and it is quite slow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Runtime tab (not shown here) specifies stopping conditions for the algorithm. You can accept the defaults, and you can always stop the training prematurely if it doesn’t seem to be making any improvement.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once you click Next on any of the tabs, you will see a summary (not shown here) of the model setup. Then you can click its Train button to start the algorithm. You will see a progress monitor, and eventually you will see results on a new sheet, the most important of which are shown in Figure 17.11. (As in other Palisade add-ins, the results are stored by default in a new workbook. You can change this behavior from the Application Settings dialog box, available from the Utilities dropdown list.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The top part shows classification results for the 80%, or 685, cases used for training. About 10% of the No values (row 31) were classified incorrectly, and about 6.5% of the Yes values (row 32) were classified incorrectly. The bottom part shows similar results for the 20%, or 171, cases used for testing. The incorrect percentages, about 24% and 16%, are not as good as for thetraining set, but this is not unusual. Also, these results are slightly better than those from logistic regression, where about 18% of the classifications were incorrect. (Remember, however, that the data set wasn’t partitioned into training and testing subsets for logistic regression.) These results are from an 80–20 random split of the original data. The results you get from a different random split will probably be different.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now that the model has been trained, it can be used to predict the unknown values of the dependent variable in the Prediction Data set. To do so, you activate the Prediction Data sheet, click Predict on the NeuralTools ribbon, and then fill out the resulting dialog box as shown in Figure 17.12. If there are multiple trained nets, you can browse for the one you want to use in the Net to Use box. The Enable Live Prediction option provides real-time predictions: If values of the explanatory variables change for any cases in the prediction set, the predictions will update automatically.</p>
 <p class="blog">
After you click Next, you will see a Prediction Preview dialog box, and you can click its Predict button. At this point, NeuralTools runs each of the cases in the Prediction Data sheet through the trained net and displays the results next tothe prediction data. A few of these are shown in Figure 17.13. However, be careful about interpreting the Prediction% column. Unlike the StatTools logistic regression output, each percentage shown here is the probability that the prediction is correct, not the probability that the person is a trier. For example, the first person is classified as a nontrier, and there is 89.89% confidence that this classification is correct. Equivalently, the probability is only 10.11% that this person is a trier.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As indicated earlier, these results are live. For example, if you change the Live Alone and Mall Trips data for the first person to Yes and 8, respectively, you will see that the prediction changes to Yes, with very high confidence. This feature lets you experiment with explanatory data values to see their effect on the predictions. This doesn’t explain exactly how the neural net “black box” is working, but it helps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 The abbreviation PN/GRN is a bit confusing. For classification problems, the algorithm is called probabilistic neural net (PNN). However, if the dependent variable is continuous, the same basic algorithm is called generalized regression neural net, which explains the GRN abbreviation.</p>
