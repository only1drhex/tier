<strong>Discussion of Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Overall plots. The overall picture of the flow is displayed in Fig. E8.3.2. After the initial small &#8220;free-flow&#8221; entrance region, the formation of boundary layers on the two plates is very evident, either by examining the movement of the streamlines away from the plates or by noting the reduction in velocity adjacent to the plates. From continuity, this velocity reduction also causes an acceleration in the middle of the stream.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results for the cross section A-A are shown in Figs. E8.3.3-E8.3.5, for which we make the following comments:</p>
 <ol> <li>The velocity <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}\)</span> in the primary flow direction is still essentially flat in the central region, falling to zero as the wall is reached.</li> </ol> <p class="blog">
(a) At values of <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> that are clearly in the boundary layer, such as <span class="tex-text">\(x=-0.008\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x=0.008\)</span> in Fig. E8.3.3, <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}\)</span> would continue to decrease in the <span class="tex-text">\(y\)</span> direction, so that <span class="tex-text">\(\partial v_{y} / \partial y\)</span> is negative at these locations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) In the central core <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}\)</span> continues to accelerate as seen in Fig. E8.3.2(c), so that the reverse occurs and <span class="tex-text">\(\partial v_{y} / \partial y\)</span> is positive.</p>
 <ol start="2"> <li>Following on Item 1 (a), the continuity equation, <span class="tex-text">\(\partial v_{x} / \partial x+\partial v_{y} / \partial y=0\)</span>, mandates that <span class="tex-text">\(\partial v_{x} / \partial x\)</span> must be positive in the boundary layer, and this is evidenced in Fig. E8.3.4 at, for example, <span class="tex-text">\(x=-0.008\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x=0.008\)</span>. Conversely, from Item <span class="tex-text">\(1(\mathrm{~b}), \partial v_{x} / \partial x\)</span> must be negative in the central core, and this is also seen.</li> <li>The vorticity is <span class="tex-text">\(\zeta=\partial v_{y} / \partial x-\partial v_{x} / \partial y \doteq \partial v_{y} / \partial x\)</span> (because <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y} \gg v_{x}\)</span> ), leading to a positive vorticity (counterclockwise rotation) near the left-hand plate and a negative vorticity (clockwise rotation) near the right-hand plate. In the central region the vorticity is essentially zero because <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}\)</span> is virtually constant there.</li> </ol> <p class="blog">
Values at point <span class="tex-text">\(P\)</span>. Finally, we investigate the pressure <span class="tex-text">\(p\)</span> and velocity <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}\)</span> at the entrance point <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{P}\)</span> and exit. By constructing a surface plot for <span class="tex-text">\(p\)</span> (we already have one for the magnitude of the velocity, which is essentially <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span> ), and clicking on <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{P}(x=0, y=0.01)\)</span> and the exit <span class="tex-text">\((x=0, y=0.05)\)</span>, we find <span class="tex-text">\(p=0.3340 \mathrm{~Pa}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}=0.02215 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> at point P. Similarly, the exit centerline values are <span class="tex-text">\(p=0\)</span> (given) and <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}=0.02984\)</span>. As expected at the centerline, there is an acceleration from P to the exit and a corresponding reduction in pressure, and we leave it to the reader to check numerically to what extent these values conform to Bernoulli&#8217;s equation.</p>
