To illustrate the solution of the multifacility, rectilinear minisum location problem, consider a situation in which a new electronics product is to be manufactured and assembled. Four machines currently located in the production area will be used, along with two new machines that have been purchased. A portion of incoming material moves from new machine 1 to new machine 2; the remainder moves from new machines to the existing machines.<br /> The material flows, expressed in thousands of units, are as follows: <span class="tex-text">\(w_{11} = 10, w_{12} = 6, w_{13} = 0, w_{14}= 0, w_{21} = 0, w_{22}= 2, w_{23} =16, w_{24} = 8,\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(v_{12} = 12.\)</span> The existing machines have the following coordinates: <span class="tex-text">\(P_{1} = (0, 10), P_{2} = (15, 0), P_{3}= (25, 30),\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(P_{4} = (40, 15).\)</span><br /> The resulting linear programming formulation is</p>

For large problems, mathematical programming software can be used to solve<br /> the multifacility, rectilinear minisum location problem. However, for this example, we will use Excel®. Specifically, the SOLVER tool will be used to obtain a solution for the example.<br /> Figure 10.11 illustrates the steps taken to solve the example using SOLVER. In (a), we show the formulation of the problem for both the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates; the 12 decision variables are shown in rows 3 and 13. Cells <span class="tex-text">\(C_{4}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(C_{14}\)</span> contain the value of the</p>
 <p class="blog">
objective function, based on the values shown for the decision variables. In this case, we chose values of 0 for all of the decision variables; obviously, the constraints are not satisfied with this initial solution. In (b), we show several of the SOLVER parameters; not shown, but included, are all of the nonnegativity constraints for the decision variables p, q, r, and s. In<br /> (c), we see the solution obtained (<span class="tex-text">\(x_{1} = 15\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} =25)\)</span> for the x-coordinates, with an objective function value of 410.<br /> The SOLVER parameter box shown in (d) was used to determine the optimum<br /> y-coordinates; again, although not visible in the figure, the nonnegativity constraints are</p>
 <p class="blog">
included in the SOLVER parameter box. In (e), the optimum values for the y-coordinates are shown:<span class="tex-text">\( y_{1} = 10\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(y_{2} = 15,\)</span> yielding an objective function value of 390. Hence, the total distance traveled is 410 + 390, or 800. The optimum locations for the two new facilities are <span class="tex-text">\(X^{*}_{1} = (15, 10)\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(X^{*}_{2} = (25, 15)\)</span>.<br /> Instead of using SOLVER to solve the linear programming problem, why not use SOLVER with the original problem? As shown in Figures 10.12 (a), (b), and (c), an identical solution was obtained for the x- and y-coordinates without having to transform the problem</p>
 <p class="blog">
into a linear programming problem. However, SOLVER is not guaranteed to yield an optimal solution. As shown in Figures 10.12 (d) and (e), with an initial solution of <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1} = x_{2} = y_{1} = y_{2} = 0\)</span>, SOLVER yields a solution of <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1} = x_{2} = y_{1} = y_{2} = 0\)</span>. Because the Excel® tool produces a solution using a search routine, it is possible for the search to terminate prematurely and yield a non-optimum solution.<br /> Using SOLVER does not provide a direct indication of multiple optimum solutions. By using different starting values for the decision variables, if multiple optimum solutions exist,</p>
 <p class="blog">
you might “get lucky” and find several. In this case, we were unable to identify any additional optimum solutions by using different initial conditions for SOLVER.<br /> Figure 10.13 depicts graphically the locations of the new and existing facilities for the example. Also shown are rectilinear paths that can be taken.<br /> The dual of the linear programming formulation can be solved as a network flow problem. For those interested in exploring other ways of obtaining exact solutions to</p>
 <p class="blog">
the multifacility, rectilinear minisum location problem, we refer you to [26] and the research literature.<br /> SOLVER is not guaranteed to obtain an optimum solution to the linear programming problem. The Excel® tool produces a solution using a search routine; hence, it is possible for the search to terminate prematurely and yield a non-optimum solution.<br /> We chose to use SOLVER because of its familiarity and accessibility to students.<br /> As Excel® users, they know that GOAL SEEK, SOLVER, and a number of<br /> worksheet functions can produce inaccurate solutions. Because of its convenience and because we only consider relatively small-sized problems, we use it here and in the problems at the end of the chapter. Additionally, we continue to refer to SOLVER solutions as optimum solutions, knowing they might not be.<br /> For problems that are too large or too cumbersome to obtain exact solutions<br /> to the linear programming formulation using SOLVER, a coordinate descent procedure can be used to obtain a solution that is often optimum or near-optimum.<br /> Specifically, we take advantage of the median conditions that exist in single-facility problems and solve for the conditional optimum value of one x-coordinate, based on assigned values for the remaining x-coordinates. Iteratively, we move through the new facilities, solving for the conditional optimum x-coordinates, repeating the process until no changes occur in successive iterative rounds of calculations. The following example illustrates the coordinate descent procedure.</p>
