With this much data, 1000 observations, it is possible to set aside part of the data set for validation, as discussed in Section 10-7. Although any split can be used, we decided to base the regression on the first 750 observations and use the other 250 for validation. Therefore, if you use StatTools, you should select only the range through row 751 when defining the StatTools data set.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can begin by entering all of the potential explanatory variables. The goal is then to exclude variables that aren’t necessary, based on their t-values and p-values. The multiple regression output with all explanatory variables appears in Figure 11.8. It indicates a fairly good fit. The <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> value is 74.7% and <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> is about $491. Given that the actual amounts spent in the current year vary from a low of under $50 to a high of over $5500, with a median of about $950, a typical prediction error of around $491 is decent but not great.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the p-value column, you can see that there are four variables, Age, Gender, Own Home, and Married, that have p-values well above 0.05. These are the obvious candidates for exclusion from the equation. You could rerun the equation with all four of these variables excluded, but it is a better practice to exclude one variable at a time. It is possible that when one of these variables is excluded, another one of them will become significant (the Right–Left foot phenomenon).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Actually, this did not happen. We first excluded the variable with the largest p-value, Married, and reran the regression. At this point, Age, Gender, and Own Home still had large p-values, so we excluded Age, the variable with the largest remaining p-value, and reran the regression. Next, we excluded Own Home, the variable with the largest remaining p-value, and finally, we excluded Gender because its p-value was still large. The resulting output appears in Figure 11.9. The <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> values of 74.6% and $491 are almost the same as they were with all variables included, and all of the p-values are very small.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Interpretation of Regression Equation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
This final regression equation can be interpreted as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The coefficient of Close implies that an average customer living close to stores with this type of merchandise spent about $416 less than an average customer living far from such stores.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The coefficient of Salary implies that, on average, about 1.8 cents of every extra salary dollar was spent on HyTex merchandise.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The coefficient of Children implies that about $161 less was spent for every extra child living at home.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The Previous Customer and Previous Spent terms are more difficult to interpret. Both of these terms are zero for customers who didn’t purchase from HyTex in the previous year. For those who did, the terms become -544 + 0.27Previous Spent. The coefficient 0.27 implies that each extra dollar spent the previous year can be expected to contribute an extra 27 cents in the current year. The 2544 literally means that if you compare a customer who didn’t purchase from HyTex last year to another customer who purchased only a tiny amount, the latter is expected to spend about $544 less than the former this year. However, none of the latter customers were in the data set. A look at the data shows that of all customers who purchased from HyTex last year, almost all spent at least $100 and most spent considerably more. In fact, the median amount spent by these customers last year was about $900 (the median of all positive values for the Previous Spent variable). If you substitute this median value into the expression -544 + 0.27 Previous Spent, you obtain 2298. Therefore, this “median” spender from last year can be expected to spend about $298 less this year than the previous year nonspender.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The coefficient of Catalogs implies that each extra catalog can be expected to generate about $44 in extra spending.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We conclude this example with two cautionary notes. First, if you validate this final regression equation on the other 250 customers, using the procedure from Section 10-7, you will find <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> values of 73.2% and $490. (This analysis is included in the finished version of the file.) These are very promising. They are very close to the values based on the original 750 customers. Second, we haven’t tried all possibilities yet. We haven’t tried nonlinear or interaction variables, nor have we looked at different coding schemes (such as treating Catalogs as a categorical variable and using dummy variables to represent it). Also, we haven’t checked for nonconstant error variance (Figure 11.1 is based on this data set) or looked at the potential effects of outliers.</p>
