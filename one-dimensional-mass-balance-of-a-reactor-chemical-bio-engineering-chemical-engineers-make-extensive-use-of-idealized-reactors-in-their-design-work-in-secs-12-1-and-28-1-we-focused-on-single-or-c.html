            <p class="blog">ONE-DIMENSIONAL MASS BALANCE OF A REACTOR (CHEMICAL/BIO ENGINEERING)</p> <p class="blog">Chemical engineers make extensive use of idealized reactors in their design work. In Secs. 12.1 and 28.1, we focused on single or coupled well-mixed reactors. These are examples of lumped-parameter systems (recall Sec. PT3.1.2).</p> <p class="blog">Figure 32.1 depicts an elongated reactor with a single entry and exit point. This reactor can be characterized as a distributed-parameter system. If it is assumed that the chemical being modeled is subject to first-order decay¹ and the tank is well-mixed vertically and laterally, a mass balance can be performed on a finite segment of length Δx, as in</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(V \frac{\Delta c}{\Delta t}=\underbrace{Q c(x)}_{\text {Flow in }}-\underbrace{Q\left[c(x)+\frac{\partial c(x)}{\partial x} \Delta x\right]}_{\text {Flow out }}-\underbrace{D A_{c} \frac{\partial c(x)}{\partial x}}_{\text {Dispersion in }}+\underbrace{D A_{c}\left[\frac{\partial c(x)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\partial c(x)}{\partial x} \Delta x\right]}_{\text {Dispersion out }}-\underbrace{k V c}_{\text {Decay reaction }}\)</span> (32.1)</p> <p class="blog">where V = volume (<span class="tex-text">\(m^3\)</span>), Q = flow rate (<span class="tex-text">\(m^3/h\)</span>), c is concentration (<span class="tex-text">\(moles/m^3\)</span>), D is a dispersion coefficient (<span class="tex-text">\(m^2/h\)</span>), Ac is the tank’s cross-sectional area (<span class="tex-text">\(m^2\)</span>), and k is the first order decay coefficient (<span class="tex-text">\(h^{-1}\)</span>). Note that the dispersion terms are based on Fick’s first law,</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\text { Flux }=-D \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}\)</span> (32.2)</p> <p class="blog">which is directly analogous to Fourier’s law for heat conduction [recall Eq.

The parameter D, therefore, reflects the magnitude of turbulent mixing. If Δx and Δt are allowed to approach zero, Eq. (32.1) becomes</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D \frac{\partial^{2} c}{\partial x^{2}}-U \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}-k c\)</span> (32.3)</p> <p class="blog">where <span class="tex-text">\(U = Q/A_c\)</span> is the velocity of the water fl owing through the tank. The mass balance for Fig. 32.1 is, therefore, now expressed as a parabolic partial differential equation. Equation (32.3) is sometimes referred to as the advection-dispersion equation with first order reaction. At steady state, it is reduced to a second-order ODE,</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(0=D \frac{d^{2} c}{d x^{2}}-U \frac{d^{2} c}{d x}-k c\)</span> (32.4)</p> <p class="blog">Prior to t = 0, the tank is filled with water that is devoid of the chemical. At t = 0, the chemical is injected into the reactor’s inflow at a constant level of <span class="tex-text">\( c_{ in }\)</span>. Thus, the following boundary conditions hold:</p> <span class="tex-text">\(Q c_{ in }=Q c_{0}-D A_{c} \frac{\partial c_{0}}{\partial x}\)</span> <p class="blog">and</p> <p class="blog">c'(L, t) = 0</p> <p class="blog">The second condition specifies that the chemical leaves the reactor purely as a function of flow through the outlet pipe. That is, it is assumed that dispersion in the reactor does not affect the exit rate. Under these conditions, use numerical methods to solve Eq. (32.4) for the steady-state levels in the reactor. Note that this is an ODE boundary-value problem. Then solve Eq. (32.3) to characterize the transient response—that is, how the levels change in time as the system approaches the steady state. This application involves a PDE.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/بدون-عنوان-130-768x179.png"></div>

A steady-state solution can be developed by substituting centered finite differences for the first and the second derivatives in Eq. (32.4) to give</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(0=D \frac{c_{i+1}-2 c_{i}+c_{i-1}}{\Delta x^{2}}-U \frac{c_{i+1}-c_{i-1}}{2 \Delta x}-k c_{i}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Collecting terms gives</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(-\left(\frac{D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{1}{2}\right) c_{i-1}+\left(\frac{2 D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{k \Delta x}{U}\right) c_{0}-\left(\frac{D}{U \Delta x}-\frac{1}{2}\right) c_{i+1}=0\)</span> (32.5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This equation can be written for each of the system’s nodes. At the reactor’s ends, this process introduces nodes that lie outside the system. For example, at the inlet node (i = 0),</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(-\left(\frac{D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{1}{2}\right) c_{-1}+\left(\frac{2 D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{k \Delta x}{U}\right) c_{0}-\left(\frac{D}{U \Delta x}-\frac{1}{2}\right) c_{1}=0\)</span> (32.6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The <span class="tex-text">\(c_{-1}\)</span> can be removed by invoking the first boundary condition. At the inlet, the following mass balance must hold:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Q c_{ in }=Q c_{0}-D A_{c} \frac{\partial c_{0}}{\partial x}\)</span> <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(c_0\)</span> = concentration at x = 0. Thus, this boundary condition specifies that the amount of chemical carried into the tank by advection through the pipe must be equal to the amount carried away from the inlet by both advection and turbulent dispersion in the tank. A finite divided difference can be substituted for the derivative</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Q c_{\text {in }}=Q c_{0}-D A_{c} \frac{c_{1}-c_{-1}}{2 \Delta x}\)</span> <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
A similar exercise can be performed for the outlet, where the original difference equation is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(-\left(\frac{D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{1}{2}\right) c_{n-1}+\left(\frac{2 D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{k \Delta x}{U}\right) c_{n}-\left(\frac{D}{U \Delta x}-\frac{1}{2}\right) c_{n+1}=0\)</span> (32.8)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The boundary condition at the outlet is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Q c_{n}-D A_{c} \frac{d c_{n}}{d x}=Q c_{n}\)</span> <p class="blog">
As with the inlet, a divided difference can be used to approximate the derivative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Q c_{n}-D A_{c} \frac{c_{n+1}-c_{n-1}}{2 \Delta x}=Q c_{n}\)</span> (32.9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Inspection of this equation leads us to conclude that cn11 5 cn21. In other words, the slope at the outlet must be zero for Eq. (32.9) to hold. Substituting this result into Eq. (32.8) and simplifying gives</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(-\left(\frac{2 D}{U \Delta x}\right) c_{n-1}+\left(\frac{2 D}{U \Delta x}+\frac{k \Delta x}{U}\right) c_{n}=0\)</span> (32.10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equations (32.5), (32.7), and (32.10) now form a system of n tridiagonal equations with n unknowns. For example, if D = 2, U = 1, Δx = 2.5, k = 0.2, and <span class="tex-text">\(c_{in} = 100\)</span>, the system is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}5.35 &amp; -1.6 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\-1.3 &amp; 2.1 &amp; -0.3 &amp; &amp; \\&amp; -1.3 &amp; 2.1 &amp; -0.3 &amp; \\&amp; &amp; -1.3 &amp; 2.1 &amp; -0.3 \\&amp; &amp; &amp; -1.6 &amp;2.1\end{array}\right]\left\{\begin{array}{l}c_{0} \\c_{1} \\c_{2} \\c_{3} \\c_{4}\end{array}\right\}=\left\{\begin{array}{c}325 \\0 \\0 \\0 \\0\end{array}\right\}\)</span> <p class="blog">

 <span class="tex-text">\(c_{3}=25.05 \quad c_{4}=19.09\)</span> <p class="blog">
These results are plotted in Fig. 32.2. As expected, the concentration decreases due to the decay reaction as the chemical flows through the tank. In addition to the above computation, Fig. 32.2 shows another case with D = 4. Notice how increasing the turbulent mixing tends to flatten the curve.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In contrast, if dispersion is decreased, the curve would become steeper as mixing became less important relative to advection and decay. It should be noted that if dispersion is decreased too much, the computation will become subject to numerical errors. This type of error is referred to as static instability to contrast it with the dynamic instability due to too large a time step during a dynamic computation. The criterion to avoid this static instability is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta x \leq \frac{2 D}{U}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Thus, the criterion becomes more stringent (lower Δx) for cases where advection dominates over dispersion.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Aside from steady-state computations, numerical methods can be used to generate time variable solutions of Eq. (32.3). Figure 32.3 shows results for D = 2, U = 1, Δx = 2.5, k = 0.2, and <span class="tex-text">\(c_{in} = 100\)</span>, where the concentration in the tank is 0 at time zero. As expected, the immediate impact is near the inlet. With time, the solution eventually approaches the steady-state level.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It should be noted that in such dynamic calculations, the time step is constrained by a stability criterion expressed as (Chapra, 1997)</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta t \leq \frac{(\Delta x)^{2}}{2 D+k(\Delta x)^{2}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Thus, the reaction term acts to make the time step smaller.</p>

¹That is, the chemical decays at a rate that is linearly proportional to how much chemical is present.</p>
