            <p class="blog"><strong>LONG-TERM VALUE OF A CUSTOMER AT CCAMERICA</strong></p> <p class="blog">CCAmerica is a credit card company that does its best to gain customers and keep their business in a highly competitive industry. The first year a customer signs up for service typically results in a loss to the company because of various administrativeexpenses. However, after the first year, the profit from a customer is typically positive, and this profit tends to increase through the years. The company has estimated the mean profit from a typical customer to be as shown in column B of Figure 16.28 below. (See the file Customer Loyalty.xlsx.) For example, the company expects to lose $40 in the customer’s first year but to gain $87 in the fifth year—provided that the customer stays loyal that long. For modeling purposes, we assume that the actual profit from a customer in a customer’s given year of service is normally distributed with mean shown in Figure 16.28 and standard deviation equal to 10% of the mean. At the end of each year, the customer leaves the company, never to return, with probability 0.15, the churn rate. Alternatively, the customer stays with probability 0.85, the retention rate. The company wants to estimate the NPV of the net profit from any such customer who has just signed up for service at the beginning of year 1, at a discount rate of 8%, assuming that the cash flow occurs in the middle of the year.<span class="tex-text">\(^{3} \)</span> It also wants to see how sensitive this NPV is to the retention rate.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use simulation to find the NPV of a customer, and to see how this varies with the retention rate.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The numbers in column B of Figure 16.28 are undoubtedly averages, based on the historical records of many customers. To build in randomness for any particular customer, we need a probability distribution around the numbers in this figure. We arbitrarily chose a normal distribution centered on the historical average and a standard deviation of 10% of the average. These are educated guesses. Finally, the churn rate is a number very familiar to marketing people, and it can also be estimated from historical customer data.</p> <p class="blog">3 This assumption makes the NPV calculation slightly more complex, but it is probably more realistic than the usual assumption that cash flows occur at the ends of the years.</p>

The variables for this model appear in Figure 16.27. (See the file Customer Loyalty Big Picture .xlsx.) The idea is to keep simulating profits (or a loss in the first year) for the customer until the customer churns. We simulate 30 years of potential profits, but this could be varied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As usual, Excel’s RAND function can be used inside an IF statement to determine whether a given event occurs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The simulation model appears in Figure 16.28. (See the file Customer Loyalty Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed with the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the given inputs in the blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Retention rate. Although an 85% retention rate was given in the statement of the problem, it is useful to investigate retention rates from 75% to 95%, as shown in row 4. To run a separate simulation for each of these, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable(D4:H4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Timing of churn. In column C, use simulation to discover when the customer churns. This column will contain a sequence of No values, followed by a Yes, and then a sequence of blanks (or all No values if the customer never churns). To generate these, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(RAND()&lt;1-B4,”Yes”,”No”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(C11*&lt;&gt;”No”,””,IF(RAND()&lt;1-$B$4,”Yes”,”No”))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells C11 and C12, and copy the latter formula down column C. Study these formulas carefully to see how the logic works. Note that they do not rely on @RISK functions. Excel’s RAND function can be used any time you want to simulate whether or not an event occurs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Careful discounting is required if cash flows occur in the middle of a year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Actual and discounted profits. Profits (or a loss in the first year) occur as long as there is not a blank in column C. Therefore, simulate the actual profits by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(C11&lt;&gt;””,RiskNormal(B11,$B$6*ABS(B11)),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D11 and copying it down. (The absolute value function, ABS, is required in case any of the cash flows are negative. A normal distribution cannot have a negative standard deviation.) Then discount these appropriately in column E by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D11/(11$B$5)^(A11-0.5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell E11 and copying it down. Note how the exponent of the denominator accounts for the cash flow in the middle of the year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Outputs. Keep track of two outputs, the total NPV and the number of years the customer stays with the company. Calculate the NPV in cell H10 by summing the discounted values in column E. (They have already been discounted, so the NPV function is not needed.) To find the number of years the customer is loyal, count the number of No values plus the number of Yes values, that is, all nonblanks. Calculate this in cell H11 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=COUNTIF(C11:C40,”No”)1COUNTIF(C11:C40,”Yes”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, designate both of cells H10 and H11 as @RISK output cells</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of simulations to 5 (one for each potential retention rate). Then run the simulation as usual.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Summary results for all five retention rates appear in Figure 16.29. You can see that the mean NPV and the mean number of years loyal are quite sensitive to the retention rate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Varying the retention rate can have a large impact on the value of a customer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To follow up on this observation, you can use the RiskMean function to capture the means in columns I and J of the model sheet and then create line charts of them as a function of the retention rate. (See Figure 16.28, where years loyal is shown on a secondary axis.) These line charts show the rather dramatic effect the retention rate can have on the value of a customer. For example, if it increases from the current 85% to 90%, the mean NPV increases by about 47%. If it increases from 85% to 95%, the mean NPV increases by about 151%. In the other direction, if the retention rate decreases from 85% to 80%, the mean NPV decreases by about 30%. This is why credit card companies are so anxious to keep their customers.</p>
