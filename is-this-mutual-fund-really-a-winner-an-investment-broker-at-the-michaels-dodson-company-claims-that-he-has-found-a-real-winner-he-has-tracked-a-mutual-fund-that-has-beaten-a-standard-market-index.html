The broker is no doubt tracking a lot of mutual funds, and he is probably reporting only the best of these. Therefore, we will check whether the best of many mutual funds could do at least this well purely by chance. To do this, we first specify what we mean by “purely by chance.” This means that each week, a given fund has a fifty-fifty chance of beating the market index, independently of performance in other weeks. In other words, the number of weeks where a given fund outperforms the market index is binomially distributed with n = 52 and p = 0.5. With this in mind, cell B6 of Figure 5.17 shows the probability that a given fund does at least as well—beats the market index at least 37 out of 52 weeks—as the reported fund. (See the Beating the Market Finished.xlsx file.) Because <span class="tex-text">\(P(X \geq 37)=1-P(X \leq 36)\)</span>, the relevant formula is</p>
 <p class="blog">
= 1–BINOM.DIST(B3−1,B4,0.5,TRUE)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Obviously, this probability, 0.00159, is quite small. A single fund isn’t likely to beat the market this often purely by chance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, the probability that the best of many mutual funds does at least this well is much larger. To calculate this probability, assume that 400 funds are being tracked, and let Y be the number of these that beat the market at least 37 of 52 weeks. Then Y is also binomially distributed, with parameters n = 400 and p = 0.00159, the probability calculated previously. To see whether any of the 400 funds beats the market at least 37 of 52 weeks, calculate <span class="tex-text">\(P(Y \geq 1)=1-P(Y=0)\)</span> in cell B9 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
= 1–BINOM.DIST(0,B8,B7,TRUE)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(Can you see why the fourth argument could be TRUE or FALSE?) The resulting probability is nearly 0.5—that is, there is nearly a fifty-fifty chance that at least one of 400 funds will do as well as the reported fund. This certainly casts doubt on the broker’s claim that he has found a real winner. It is more likely that his star fund just got lucky and will perform no better than average in succeeding weeks.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To see how the probability in cell B9 depends on the level of success of the reported fund (the value in cell B3) and the number of mutual funds being tracked (in cell B8), a two-way data table has been created in the range B13:G18. (The formula in cell B13 is =B9, the row input cell is B3, and the column input cell is B8.) As you saw, beating the market 37 times out of 52 is no big deal with 400 funds, but beating it 40 times out of 52, even with 600 funds, is something worth reporting. The probability of this happening purely by chance is only 0.038, or less than 1 out of 25.</p>
