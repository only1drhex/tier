The computation of molal volume from the van der Waals equation can be accomplished using any of the numerical methods for finding roots of equations discussed in Chaps. 5, 6, and 7, with</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(f(v)=\left(p+\frac{a}{υ^{2}}\right)(v-b)-R T\)</span> (8.3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this case, the derivative of f(υ) is easy to determine and the Newton-Raphson method is convenient and efficient to implement. The derivative of f(υ) with respect to y is given by</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(f^{\prime}(υ)=p-\frac{a}{υ^{2}}+\frac{2 a b}{υ^{3}}\)</span> (8.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Newton-Raphson method is described by Eq. (6.6):</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(x_{i+1}=x_{i}-\frac{f\left(x_{i}\right)}{f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}\right)}\)</span> <p class="blog">
which can be used to estimate the root. For example, using the initial guess of 24.6162, the molal volume of carbon dioxide at 300 K and 1 atm is computed as 24.5126 L/mol. This result was obtained after just two iterations and has an ea of less than 0.001 percent. Similar computations for all combinations of pressure and temperature for both gases are presented in Table 8.1. It is seen that the results for the ideal gas law differ from those for the van der Waals equation for both gases, depending on specific values for p and T. Furthermore, because some of these results are significantly different, your design of the containment vessels would be quite different, depending on which equation of state was used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this case, a complicated equation of state was examined using the Newton-Raphson method. The results varied significantly from the ideal gas law for several cases. From a practical standpoint, the Newton-Raphson method was appropriate for this application because f'(υ) was easy to calculate. Thus, the rapid convergence properties of the Newton-Raphson method could be exploited.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In addition to demonstrating its power for a single computation, the present design problem also illustrates how the Newton-Raphson method is especially attractive when numerous computations are required. Because of the speed of digital computers, the efficiency of various numerical methods for most roots of equations is indistinguishable for a single computation. Even a 1-s difference between the crude bisection approach and the efficient Newton-Raphson does not amount to a significant time loss when only one computation is performed. However, suppose that millions of root evaluations are required to solve a problem. In this case, the efficiency of the method could be a deciding factor in the choice of a technique.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For example, suppose that you are called upon to design an automatic computerized control system for a chemical production process. This system requires accurate estimates of molal volumes on an essentially continuous basis to properly manufacture the final product. Gauges are installed that provide instantaneous readings of pressure and temperature. Evaluations of y must be obtained for a variety of gases that are used in the process. For such an application, bracketing methods such as bisection or false position would probably be too time-consuming. In addition, the two initial guesses that are required for these approaches may also interject a critical delay in the procedure. This shortcoming is relevant to the secant method, which also needs two initial estimates.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In contrast, the Newton-Raphson method requires only one guess for the root. The ideal gas law could be employed to obtain this guess at the initiation of the process. Then, assuming that the time frame is short enough so that pressure and temperature do not vary wildly between computations, the previous root solution would provide a good guess for the next application. Thus, the close guess that is often a prerequisite for convergence of the Newton-Raphson method would automatically be available. All the above considerations would greatly favor the Newton-Raphson technique for such problems.</p>
