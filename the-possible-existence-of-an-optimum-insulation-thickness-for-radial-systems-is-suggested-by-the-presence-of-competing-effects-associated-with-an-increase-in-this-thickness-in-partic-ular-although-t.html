            <p class="blog">The possible existence of an optimum insulation thickness for radial systems is suggested by the presence of competing effects associated with an increase in this thickness. In partic-ular, although the conduction resistance increases with the addition of insulation, the con-vection resistance increases with the addition of insulation, the con-vection resistance decreases due to increasing outer surface area. Hence there may exist an insulation thickness that minimizes heat loss by maximizing the total resistance to heat transfer. Resolve this issue by considering the following system.</p> <p class="blog">1. A thin-walled copper tube of radius <span class="tex-text">\(r_{i}\)</span> is used to transport a low-temperature refrigerant and is at a temperature <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}\)</span> that is less than that of the ambient air at <span class="tex-text">\(T_{∞}\)</span> around the tube. Is there an optimum thickness associated with application of insulation to the tube?<br /> 2. Confirm the above result by computing the total thermal resistance per unit length of tube for a 10-mm-diameter tube having the following insulation thicknesses: 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mm. The insulation is composed of cellular glass, and the outer surface convection coefficient is 5 W/m² . K.</p>

Known: Radius <span class="tex-text">\(r_{i}\)</span> and temperature <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}\)</span>of a thin-walled copper tube to be insulated from the ambient air.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Find:<br /> 1. Whether there exists an optimum insulation thickness that minimizes the heat transfer rate.<br /> 2. Thermal resistance associated with using cellular glass insulation of varying thickness.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assumptions:<br /> 1. Steady-state conditions.<br /> 2. One-dimensional heat transfer in the radial (cylindrical) direction.<br /> 3. Negligible tube wall thermal resistance.<br /> 4. Constant properties for insulation.<br /> 5. Negligible radiation exchange between insulation outer surface and surroundings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Properties: , cellular glass (285 K, assumed): k = 0.055 W/m. K.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysis:<br /> 1. The resistance to heat transfer between the refrigerant and the air is dominated by con-duction in the insulation and convection in the air. The thermal circuit is therefore</p>
 <p class="blog">
where the conduction and convection resistances per unit length follow from Equations 3.33 <span class="tex-text">\( R_{t,cond} = \frac{ln(r_{2}/ r_{1})}{2\pi Lk} \)</span> and 3.9 <span class="tex-text">\( R_{t,conv} \equiv \frac{T_{s}- T_{\infty } }{q} =\frac{1}{hA}\)</span> , respectively. The total thermal resistance per unit length of tube is then</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Rَ_{tot} = \frac{ln(r/r_{i})}{2\pi k} + \frac{1}{2\pi rh}\)</span> <p class="blog">
where the rate of heat transfer per unit length of tube is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(qَ = \frac{T_{∞} &#8211; T_{i}}{Rَ_{tot}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
An optimum insulation thickness would be associated with the value of r that minimized qَ or maximized <span class="tex-text">\(Rَ_{tot}\)</span> . Such a value could be obtained from the requirement that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d Rَ_{tot}}{dr}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
Hence</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{2\pi k r} &#8211; \frac{1}{2\pi r^{2}h } = 0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
or</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(r = \frac{k}{h}\)</span> <p class="blog">
To determine whether the foregoing result maximizes or minimizes the total resis-tance, the second derivative must be evaluated. Hence</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d^{2}Rَ_{tot}}{dr^{2}} = -\frac{1}{2\pi k r^{2}} + \frac{1}{\pi r^{3}h } \)</span> <p class="blog">
or, at r = k/h,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d^{2}Rَ_{tot}}{dr^{2}} = \frac{1}{\pi (k h)^{2}} \left(\frac{1}{k} &#8211; \frac{1}{2k}\right) = \frac{1}{2 \pi k^{3} / h^{2}} \gt 0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
Since this result is always positive, it follows that r = k/h is the insulation radius for which the total resistance is a minimum, not a maximum. Hence an optimum insulation thickness does not exist.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the above result it makes more sense to think in terms of a critical insulation radius</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( r_{cr} \equiv \frac{k}{h}\)</span> <p class="blog">
which maximizes heat transfer, that is, below which qَ increases with increasing r and above which qَ decreases with increasing r.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. With h = 5 W/m² . K and k = 0.055 W/m. K, the critical radius is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( r_{cr} = \frac{ 0.055 W/m. K}{5 W/m² . K} = 0.011 m\)</span> <p class="blog">
Hence <span class="tex-text">\( r_{cr} &gt; r_{i}\)</span> and heat transfer will increase with the addition of insulation up to a thickness o</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(r_{cr} &#8211; r_{i} = (0.011 &#8211; 0.005) m = 0.006 m\)</span> <p class="blog">
The thermal resistances corresponding to the prescribed insulation thicknesses may be calculated and are plotted as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comments:<br /> 1. The effect of the critical radius is revealed by the fact that, even for 20 mm of insula-tion, the total resistance is not as large as the value for no insulation.<br /> 2. If <span class="tex-text">\( r_{i} &lt; r_{cr} \)</span>, as it is in this case, the total resistance decreases and the heat rate therefore increases with the addition of insulation. This trend continues until the outer radius of the insulation corresponds to the critical radius. The trend is desirable for electrical current flow through a wire, since the addition of electrical insulation would aid in transferring heat dissipated in the wire to the surroundings. Conversely, if <span class="tex-text">\(r_{i} &gt; r_{cr}\)</span>, any addition of insulation would increase the total resistance and therefore decrease the heat loss. This behavior would be desirable for steam flow through a pipe, where insu-lation is added to reduce heat loss to the surroundings.<br /> 3. For radial systems, the problem of reducing the total resistance through the application of insulation exists only for small diameter wires or tubes and for small convection coeffi-cients, such that <span class="tex-text">\(r_{cr} &gt; r_{i}\)</span> . For a typical insulation (k ≈ 0.03 W/m. K) and free convection in air (h ≈ 10 W/m² . K), <span class="tex-text">\(r_{cr} \)</span>= (k/h) ≈ 0.003 m. Such a small value tells us that, normally, <span class="tex-text">\(r_{i} &gt; r_{cr}\)</span> and we need not be concerned with the effects of a critical radius.<br /> 4. The existence of a critical radius requires that the heat transfer area change in the direction of transfer, as for radial conduction in a cylinder (or a sphere). In a plane wall the area per-pendicular to the direction of heat flow is constant and there is no critical insulation thick-ness (the total resistance always increases with increasing insulation thickness).</p>
