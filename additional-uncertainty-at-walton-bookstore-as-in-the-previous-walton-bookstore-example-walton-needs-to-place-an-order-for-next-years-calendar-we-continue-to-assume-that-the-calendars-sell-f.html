            <p class="blog"><strong>ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AT WALTON BOOKSTORE</strong></p> <p class="blog">As in the previous Walton Bookstore example, Walton needs to place an order for next year’s calendar. We continue to assume that the calendars sell for $10 and customer demand for the calendars at this price is triangularly distributed with minimum value,equal to 100, 175, and 300. However, there are now two other sources of uncertainty. First, the maximum number of calendars Walton’s supplier can supply is uncertain and is modeled with a triangular distribution. Its parameters are 125 (minimum), 200 (most likely), and 250 (maximum). Once Walton places an order, the supplier will charge $7.50 per calendar if it can supply the entire Walton order. Otherwise, it will charge only $7.25 per calendar. Second, unsold calendars can no longer be returned to the supplier for a refund. Instead, Walton will put them on sale for $5 apiece after January 1. At that price, Walton believes the demand for leftover calendars is triangularly distributed with parameters 0, 50, and 75. Any calendars still left over, say, after March 1, will be thrown away. Walton again wants to use simulation to analyze the resulting profit for various order quantities.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To develop and analyze a simulation model with multiple sources of uncertainty using @RISK, and to introduce @RISK’s sensitivity analysis features.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">As in , the monetary values are straightforward, and the parameters of the triangular distributions are probably educated guesses, possibly based on experience with previous calendars.</p>

The variables for this model, including the three sources of uncertainty, are shown in Figure 15.37. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; More Uncertainty Big Picture.xlsx.) Using this as a guide, the first step, as always, is to develop the model. Then you can run the simulation with @RISK and examine the results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong><br /> The completed model is shown in Figure 15.38. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; More Uncertainty Finished.xlsx.) The model itself requires a bit more logic than the previous Walton model. It can be developed with the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Random inputs. There are three random inputs in this model: the maximum supply the supplier can provide Walton, the customer demand when the selling price is $10, and the customer demand for sale-price calendars. Generate these in cells B14, E14, and H14 (using the ROUND function to obtain integers) with the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(RiskTriang(I5,I6,I7),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(RiskTriang (E5,E6,E7),0)<br /> and<br /> =ROUND(RiskTriang (F5,F6,F7),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The formula in cell H14 generates the random potential demand for calendars at the sale price, even though there might not be any calendars left to put on sale.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Walton Model with Multiple Uncertain Inputs</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Actual supply. The number of calendars supplied to Walton is the smaller of the number ordered and the maximum the supplier is able to supply. Calculate this value in cell C14 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MIN(B14,Order_quantity)</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Order cost. Walton gets the reduced price, $7.25, if the supplier cannot supply the entire order. Otherwise, Walton must pay $7.50 per calendar. Therefore, calculate the total order cost in cell D14 with the formula (using the obvious range names)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B14&gt;=Order_quantity,Unit_cost_1,Unit_cost_2)*C14</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Other quantities. The rest of the model is straightforward. Calculate the revenue from regular-price sales in cell F14 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Regular_price*MIN(C14,E14)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Calculate the number left over after regular-price sales in cell G14 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MAX(C14-E14,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Calculate the revenue from sale-price sales in cell I14 with the formula<br /> =Sale_price*MIN(G14,H140)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, calculate profit in cell J14 with the formula<br /> =F14+I14-D14</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then designate this cell as an @RISK output cell. If you like, you can also designate other cells (the revenue cells, for example) as output cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Order quantities. As before, enter the following RiskSimtable formula in cell B10 so that Walton can try different order quantities:</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable(D10:H10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong><br /> As usual, the next steps are to specify the simulation settings (we chose 1000 iterations and 5 simulations), and run the simulation. It is important to realize what @RISK does when it runs a simulation when there are several random input cells. In each iteration, @RISK generates a random value for each input variable independently. In this example, it generates a maximum supply in cell B14 from one triangular distribution, it generates a regular-price demand in cell E14 from another triangular distribution, and it generates a sale-price demand in cell H14 from a third triangular distribution. With these input values, it then calculates profit. For each order quantity, it then iterates this procedure 1000 times and keeps track of the corresponding profits<span class="tex-text">\(^{8}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Selected results are listed in Figure 15.38 (at the bottom), and the profit histogram for an order quantity of 200 is shown in Figure 15.39. (The histograms for the other order quantities are similar to what you have seen before, with more skewness to the left and a larger spike to the right as the order quantity decreases.) For this order quantity, the results indicate an average profit of $393.48, a 5th percentile of $49.00, a 95th percentile of $525, and a distribution of profits that is again skewed to the left.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We now demonstrate a useful feature of @RISK when there are several random input cells. This feature lets you see which of these inputs has the most effect on an output cell. To perform this analysis, select the profit cell, J14, and click the Browse Results button. You will see a histogram of profit, as we have already discussed, with a number of buttons at the bottom of the window. Click the red button with the pound sign to select a simulation. We chose #3, where the order quantity is 200. Then click the “tornado” button (the fifth button from the left) and choose Change in Output Mean from its dropdown list. This produces the graph in Figure 15.40. (The Regression and Correlation options produce similar results.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This figure shows graphically and numerically how each of the random inputs affects profit: the longer the bar, the stronger the relationship between that input and profit. Specifically, each bar shows how the mean profit varies as each input varies over its range (and the other inputs are held constant). In this sense, you can see that the regular-price demand has by far the largest effect on profit. The other two inputs, maximum supply and sale-price demand, have much smaller effects. Identifying important input variables is important for real applications. If a random input has a large effect on an important output, then it is probably worth the time and money to learn more about this input and possibly reduce the amount of uncertainty involving it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A tornado graph indicates which of the random inputs have large effects on an output.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8 It is also possible to correlate the inputs, as we demonstrate in the next section.</p>
