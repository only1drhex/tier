As in the previous chapter, we include a template file, Hypothesis Test Template.xlsx, to calculate the details of most of the tests in this chapter. It is very similar to the template file for confidence intervals. The results for this example are based on the HT Mean template sheet and appear in Figure 9.3. (See the file Pizza Ratings Finished.xlsx.) Again, orange shading is used for the cells you need to fill. The template automatically calculates the formulas in the other cells. In this case, you need to specify the type of test from a dropdown list in cell B2, the hypothesized mean in cell B3, and the sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation, based on the data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the summary statistics, you can see that the sample mean is <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{X}=2.10\)</span> and the sample standard deviation is s = 4.717. This positive sample mean provides some evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, but given the rather large value of s, does it provide enough evidence to reject <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0}\)</span>?</p>
 <p class="blog">
To run the test, you calculate the test statistic in cell B9, using the borderline null hypothesis value <span class="tex-text">\(\mu_{0}=0\)</span>, and report how much probability is beyond it in the right tail of the appropriate t distribution. The right tail is appropriate because the alternative is one-tailed of the “greater than” variety.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The t-value indicates that the sample mean is slightly more than 2.8 standard errors to the right of the null value, 0. Intuitively, this provides a lot of evidence in favor of the alternative—it is quite unlikely to see a sample mean 2.8 standard errors to the right of a “true” mean. The probability beyond this value in the right tail of a t distribution with n &#8211; 1 = 39 degrees of freedom is approximately 0.004, as shown in cell B11. Note how the template uses a nested IF formula for the p-value. This covers all three possible types of alternative hypotheses: greater than, less than, or not equal to.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The p-value for the test indicates that these sample results would be very unlikely if the null hypothesis were true. The manager has two choices at this point. He can conclude that the null hypothesis is true and he obtained a very unlikely sample, or he can conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true—and presumably switch to the new-style pizza. This second conclusion certainly appears to be the more reasonable choice.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another way of interpreting the results of the test is in terms of traditional significance levels. The null hypothesis can be rejected at the 1% significance level because the p-value is less than 0.01. It can also be rejected at the 5% level or the 10% level because the p-value is also less than 0.05 and 0.10. Just remember that the p-value is the preferred way to report the results because it indicates exactly how significant these sample results are.</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
<strong>Test Statistics and ρ-values</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
All hypothesis tests are implemented by calculating a test statistic from the data and seeing how far out this test statistic is in one or both tails of some wellknown distribution. The details of this procedure might or might not be included in the output from statistical software, but the p-value is always included. The p-value specifies the probability in the tail (or tails) beyond the test statistic. In words, it measures how unlikely such an extreme value of the test statistic is if the null hypothesis is true.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before leaving this example, we ask one last question. Should the manager switch to the new-style pizza on the basis of these sample results? We would probably recommend “yes.” There is no indication that the new-style pizza costs any more to make than the old-style pizza, and the sample evidence is fairly convincing that customers, on average, prefer the new-style pizza. Therefore, unless there are reasons for not switching that we haven’t mentioned here, we recommend the switch. However, if it costs more to make the new-style pizza (and its price is no higher), hypothesis testing is not the best way to perform the decision analysis.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To complete this example, we mention how the result would change if, for whatever reason, the manager wanted to run a two-tailed test. First, the “Two-tailed &#8211; not equal to” option would be selected in cell B2. Then the formula for the p-value would use the T.DIST.2T function, which would double the p-value. This is true in general. The p-value for a two-tailed test is always double the p-value for a corresponding one-tailed test.</p>
