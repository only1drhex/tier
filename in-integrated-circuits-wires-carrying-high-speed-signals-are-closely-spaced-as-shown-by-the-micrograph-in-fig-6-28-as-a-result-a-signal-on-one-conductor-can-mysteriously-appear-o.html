The origin of crosstalk is capacitance. In particular, it is undesired capacitance, often called parasitic capacitance, that exists between wires that are closely spaced. The simple model in Fig. 6.29 can be used to investigate crosstalk between two long parallel wires. A signal is applied to wire 1. Capacitances <span class="tex-text">\(C_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2}\)</span> are the parasitic capacitances of the conductors with respect to ground, while <span class="tex-text">\(C_{12}\)</span> is the capacitance between the conductors. Recall that we introduced the capacitor as two closely spaced conducting plates. If we stretch those plates into thin wires, certainly the geometry of the conductors would change and thus the amount of capacitance. However, we should still expect some capacitance between the wires.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In order to quantify the level of crosstalk, we want to know how much of the voltage on wire 1 appears on wire 2. A nodal analysis at wire 2 yields</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i_{12}(t) = C_{12} \Big[ \frac{dv_{1}(t)}{dt} &#8211; \frac{dv_{2}(t)}{dt} \Big] = i_{2}(t) = C_{2} \Big[\frac{dv_{2}(t)}{dt}\Big] \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving for d<span class="tex-text">\(v_{2}\)</span>(t)/dt, we find that</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{dv_{2}(t)}{dt} = \Big[ \frac{C_{12}}{C_{12} + C_{2}}\Big] \frac{dv_{1}(t)}{dt}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Integrating both sides of this equation yields</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(v_{2}(t) = \Big[ \frac{C_{12}}{C_{12} + C_{2}}\Big] dv_{1}(t)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that it is a simple capacitance ratio that determines how effectively <span class="tex-text">\(v_{1}\)</span>(t) is “coupled” into wire 2. Clearly, ensuring that <span class="tex-text">\(C_{12}\)</span> is much less than <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2}\)</span> is the key to controlling crosstalk. How is this done? First, we can make <span class="tex-text">\(C_{12}\)</span> as small as possible by increasing the spacing between wires. Second, we can increase <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2}\)</span> by putting it closer to the ground wiring. Unfortunately, the first option takes up more real estate, and the second one slows down the voltage signals in wire 1. At this point, we seem to have a typical engineering tradeoff: to improve one criterion, that is, decreased crosstalk, we must sacrifice another, space or speed. One way to address the space issue would be to insert a ground connection between the signal-carrying wires as shown in Fig. 6.30. However, any advantage achieved with grounded wires must be traded off against the increase in space, since inserting grounded wires between adjacent conductors would nearly double the width consumed without them.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Redrawing the circuit in Fig. 6.31 immediately indicates that wires 1 and 2 are now electrically isolated and there should be no crosstalk whatsoever—a situation that is highly unlikely. Thus, we are prompted to ask the question, “Is our model accurate enough to model crosstalk?” A more accurate model for the crosstalk reduction scheme is shown in Fig. 6.32 where the capacitance between signal wires 1 and 2 is no longer ignored. Once again, we will determine the amount of crosstalk by examining the ratio <span class="tex-text">\(v_{2}(t)/v_{1}(t)\)</span>. Employing nodal analysis at wire 2 in the circuit in Fig. 6.33 yields</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i_{12}(t) = C_{12} \Big[ \frac{dv_{1}(t)}{dt} &#8211; \frac{dv_{2}(t)}{dt} \Big] = i_{2}(t) = (C_{2} + C_{2G}) \Big[\frac{dv_{2}(t)}{dt} \Big] \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving for d<span class="tex-text">\(v_{2}\)</span>(t)/dt, we obtain</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{dv_{2}(t)}{dt} = \Big[ \frac{C_{12}}{C_{12} + C_{2} + C_{2G}}\Big] \frac{ dv_{1}(t)}{dt}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Integrating both sides of this equation yields</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(v_{2}(t) = \Big[ \frac{C_{12}}{C_{12} + C_{2} + C_{2G}} \Big] v_{1}(t)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that this result is very similar to our earlier result with the addition of the <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2G}\)</span> term. Two benefits in this situation reduce crosstalk. First, <span class="tex-text">\(C_{12}\)</span> is smaller because adding the ground wire moves wires 1 and 2 farther apart. Second, <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2G}\)</span> makes the denominator of the crosstalk equation bigger. If we assume that <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2G} = C_{2}\)</span> and that <span class="tex-text">\(C_{12}\)</span> has been halved by the extra spacing, we can expect the crosstalk to be reduced by a factor of roughly 4.</p>
