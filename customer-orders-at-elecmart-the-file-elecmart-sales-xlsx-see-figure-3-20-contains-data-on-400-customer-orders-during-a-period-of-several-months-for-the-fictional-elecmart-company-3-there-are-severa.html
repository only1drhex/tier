First, we preview the results you can obtain. Pivot tables are useful for breaking down numeric variables by categories, or for counting observations in categories and possibly expressing the counts as percentages. So, for example, you might want to see how the average total cost for females differs from the similar average for males. Or you might simply want to see the percentage of the 400 sales made by females. Pivot tables allow you to find such averages and percentages easily.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Pivot tables are perfect for breaking down data by categories. Many people refer to this as “slicing and dicing” the data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Actually, you could find such averages or percentages without using pivot tables. For example, you could sort on gender and then find the average of the Female rows and the average of the Male rows. However, this takes time, and more complex breakdowns are even more difficult and time-consuming. They are all easy and quick with pivot tables. Besides that, the resulting tables can be accompanied with corresponding charts that require virtually no extra effort to create. Pivot tables are a manager’s dream. Fortunately, Excel makes them a manager’s reality.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We begin by building a pivot table to find the sum of Total Cost broken down by time of day and region of country. Although we show this in a number of screen shots, just to help you get the knack of it, the process takes only a few seconds after you gain some experience with pivot tables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Beginning in Excel 2013, there is a Recommended Pivot Tables option. It guesses which pivot tables you might want.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To start, click the PivotTable button at the far left on the Insert ribbon (see Figure 3.21). This produces the dialog box in Figure 3.22. The top section allows you to specify the table or range that contains the data. (You can also specify an external data source, but we will not cover this option here.) The bottom section allows you to select the location where you want the results to be placed. If you start by selecting any cell inside the data set, Excel’s guess for the table or range is usually correct, although you can override it if necessary. Make sure the range selected for this example is A1:J401. This selected range should include the variable names at the top of each column. Then click OK. Note that with these settings, the pivot table will be placed in a new worksheet with a generic name such as Sheet1. You will probably want to rename it something like Pivot Table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This produces a blank pivot table, as shown in Figure 3.23. Also, assuming any cell inside this blank pivot table is selected, the PivotTable Tools “super tab” is visible. This super tab has two ribbons, Analzye and Design. (The Analyze ribbon was named Options in Excel 2007 and 2010.) The Analyze ribbon appears in Figure 3.24, and the Design ribbon appears in Figure 3.25. Each of these has a variety of buttons for manipulating pivot tables, some of which we will explore shortly. Finally, the PivotTable Fields pane in Figure 3.26 is visible. By default, it is docked at the right of the screen, but you can move it if you like.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the two pivot table ribbons and the PivotTable Fields pane are visible only when the active cell is inside a pivot table. If you click outside the pivot table, say, in cell D1, all three of these will disappear. Don’t worry. You can get them back by selecting any cell inside the pivot table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The PivotTable Fields pane indicates that a pivot table has four areas. These are for Filters, Rows, Columns, and Values. They correspond to the four areas in Figure 3.26 where you can put fields.<span class="tex-text">\(^{4}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
A Rows field has categories that go down the left side of a pivot table, a Columns field has categories that go across the top of a pivot table, a Filters field lets you filter the pivot table by its categories, and a Values field contains the data you want to summarize. Typically (but not always), you will place categorical variables in the Filters, Rows, and/or Columns areas, and you will place numeric variables in the Values area.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the present example, check the Time, Region, and Total Cost boxes in the upper half of the PivotTable Fields pane. You immediately get the pivot table in Figure 3.27. It shows the sum of Total Cost, broken down by time of day and region of country. For example, the total cost of orders in the morning in the South was $3835.86, and the total cost of orders in the morning (over all regions) was $18,427.31.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Excel applies two rules to variables checked at the top of the PivotTable Fields pane:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• When you check a text variable or a date variable in the field list, it is added to the Rows area.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• When you check a numeric variable in the field list, it is added to the Values area and summarized with the Sum function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This is exactly what happens when you check Time, Region, and Total Cost. However, this is just the beginning. With very little work, you can do a lot more. Some of the many possibilities are explained in the remainder of this example.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are three different layouts for pivot tables, but the differences are relatively minor. Ultimately, it is a matter of taste.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First, notice that the pivot table in Figure 3.27 has both Rows fields, Time and Region, in column A. This is one of three possible layouts: Compact, Outline, or Tabular. These are available from the Report Layout dropdown list on the Design ribbon. When you create a pivot table (in an .xlsx file), you get the compact layout by default. If you would rather have the tabular<br /> or outline layout, it is easy to switch to them. In particular, the tabular layout, shown in Figure 3.28, is closer to what was used in pre-2007 versions of Excel. (Outline layout, not shown here, is very similar to tabular layout except for the placement of its subtotals.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 In discussing pivot tables, Microsoft uses the term field rather than variable, so we will do so as well.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One significant advantage to using tabular (or outline) layout instead of compact layout is that you can see which fields are in the Rows and Columns areas. Take another look at the pivot table in Figure 3.27. It is fairly obvious that categories such as Afternoon and Morning have to do with time of day and that categories such as Midwest and South have to do with region of country. However, there are no labels that explicitly name the Rows fields. In contrast, the tabular layout in Figure 3.28 names them explicitly, and it makes filtering more transparent. Some critics have been very vocal about their dislike for compact layout due to the lack of meaningful labels, and we tend to agree. Therefore, the remaining screenshots in this chapter show tabular layout.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Changing Locations of Fields</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Starting with the pivot table in Figure 3.28, you can choose where to place either Time or Region; it does not have to be in the Rows area. To place the Region variable in the Columns area, for example, drag the Region button from the Rows area of the PivotTable Fields pane to the Columns area. The pivot table changes automatically, as shown in Figure 3.29. (This is called pivoting.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that times of day in column A are now in chronological order, not in alphabetical order as they were by default. It is easy to make this change. Select the top of the Morning cell (A7) until the cursor becomes a four-way arrow and drag it above Afternoon.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can also categorize by a third field such as Gender. As before, if you check Gender in the PivotTable Fields pane, it goes to the Rows area by default, but you could then drag it to another area. The pivot table in Figure 3.30 shows the result of placing Gender in the Rows area. For example, the sum of Total Cost for morning orders by females in the West is 4211.19. You can place as many fields as you like in any area. The only downside is that the pivot table starts to get cluttered. If you want to remove a field from the pivot table, just uncheck its its item in the top part of the PivotTable Fields pane or drag it off from the bottom part of the pane.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you checked the Gender field to get Figure 3.30, you&#8217;ll notice that Gender is below Time in the Rows box. This makes Time the &#8220;outer&#8221; Rows field and Gender the &#8220;inner&#8221; Rows field in the pivot table. To reverse their roles, drag Gender above Time in the Rows box. This leads to the pivot table in Figure 3.31. The two pivot tables provide slightly different views of the same summarization, and you can choose the one you like best. This ability to categorize by multiple fields and rearrange the fields as you like is a big reason why pivot tables are so powerful and useful—and easy to use.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Changing Field Settings</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
You can change various settings in the Field Settings dialog box. You can get to this dialog box in at least two ways. First, there is a Field Setting button on the Analyze ribbon. Second, you can right-click any of the pivot table cells and select Field Settings. The field settings are particularly useful for fields in the Values area.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For now, right-click any number in the pivot table in Figure 3.31 and select Value Field Settings to obtain the dialog box in Figure 3.32. This allows you to choose how you want to summarize the Total Cost variable—by Sum, Average, Count, or several others. You can also click the Number Format button to choose from the usual number formatting options, and you can click the Show Values As tab to display the data in various ways (more on this later). If you choose Average and format as currency with two decimals, the resulting pivot table appears as in Figure 3.33. Now each number is the average of Total Cost for all orders in its combination of categories. For example, the average of Total Cost for all morning orders by females in the South is $146.00, and the average of all orders by femailes in the South is $143.31.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The key to summarizing the data the way you want it summarized is the Value Field Settings dialog box. Get used to it because you will use it often.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Filtering</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
When you place a categorical field in the Rows, Columns, or Filters area, all its categories show by default. But it is often useful to filter out, or hide, some of these categories. This lets you focus on the categories of most interest. There are several ways to filter; you can choose the method you prefer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Click the dropdown arrow next to any Rows or Columns field in the pivot table and check the categories you want to show. Alternatively, choose Label Filters from the dropdown list, which provide several useful options.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Add a field to the Filters area. Then filter with its dropdown arrow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Add a slicer (or a timeline for date fields) from the Filters group on the Analyze ribbon.<br /> These are graphical items for making filters more transparent. (Slicers were introduced in Excel 2010. Timelines were introduced in Excel 2013.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figures 3.34, 3.35, and 3.36 illustrate these three options. Figure 3.34 uses filters on Time and Region to hide the Afternoon, South, and West categories. Note that the grand totals are only for the filtered data. For example, $142.91 in cell B7 is the average of Total Cost only for the morning and evening orders in the Midwest. Also note the filter signs on the Time and Region dropdown arrows. You can click either of these to change or remove the filters.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 3.35 uses a filter for Day in the Filters area. It indicates that multiple categories were checked in the Day dropdown list. However, without opening this list, you can’t tell which days were selected. (They are Friday and Saturday.) This lack of transparency is a drawback of filters in the Filters area.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 3.36 illustrates a slicer on Day and a timeline on Date. When you select Insert Slicer from the Analyze ribbon, you can check as many fields as you like. You get a slicer for each field you check. (For a timeline, you are likely to select only a single date variable.) To choose categories from a slicer, select as many as you want in the usual way: hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple items or the Shift key to select contiguous items. It is clear from this slicer and this timeline that only orders on Fridays and Saturdays during March and April are summarized. This is the advantage of slicers and timelines. They make filters transparent. By the way, to create Figure 3.36, starting from Figure 3.35, we unchecked the Day field in the PivotTable Fields pane. However, this did not remove the filter on Day. When we inserted the slicer on Day, Friday and Saturday were already selected. Just keep this in mind. When you delete a filtered field from a pivot table, the filter is still remembered.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Slicers and timelines aren’t really part of a pivot table in the sense that when they are selected, the PivotTable Fields pane isn’t opened. However, they each have their own ribbon. For example, when you select a slicer, a Slicer Tools Options tab appears, with an associated ribbon. This lets you make several cosmetic changes to the slicer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sorting</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
You can sort by categories or values in a pivot table. We already mentioned one sort, where Morning was moved above Afternoon by dragging. However, dragging was required only because the “natural” order Morning, Afternoon, Evening is not alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order. More commonly, you will sort by clicking the dropdown arrow next to a Rows or Columns field and using one of the Sort options at the top. These include A-Z, Z-A, and More Sort Options. You can experiment with the latter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sorting by values— the values in the body of the pivot table—is also possible. For example, if you select cell E5 in Figure 3.36 and click the A-Z button on the Data ribbon, not only will cells E5, E6, and E7 will be sorted in increasing order, but (as you would hope) the entire range A5:F7 will be rearranged as well. This is just one possibility. You can also right-click a value in the pivot table, select Sort and then More Sort Options to get the dialog box in Figure 3.37. This lets you sort in increasing or decreasing order from top to bottom or from left to right. Don’t be afraid to experiment with these options. You can always press Ctrl+z to undo your sort.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Pivot Charts</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
It is easy to accompany pivot tables with pivot charts. These charts are really Excel charts, but they are better because they adapt automatically to the underlying pivot table. If you make a change to the pivot table, such as pivoting the Rows and Columns fields, the pivot chart makes the same change automatically. To create a pivot chart, click anywhere inside the pivot table, select the PivotChart button on the Analyze ribbon, and select a chart type. That’s all there is to it. The resulting pivot chart (using the default column chart option) for the pivot table in Figure 3.36 appears in Figure 3.38. If you decide to pivot the Rows and Columns fields, the pivot chart changes automatically, as shown in Figure 3.39. Note that the categories on the horizontal axis are always based on the Rows field, and the categories in the legend are always based on the Columns field.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that when you activate a pivot chart, the PivotTable Tools “super tab” changes to PivotChart Tools. This super tab includes three ribbons for manipulating pivot charts: Analyze, Design, and Format. There is not enough space here to discuss the many options on these ribbons, but they are intuitive and easy to use. As usual, don’t be afraid to experiment.</p>

<strong>Multiple Variables in the Values Area</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Multiple variables can be placed in the Values area. In addition, a given variable in the Values area can be summarized by more than one summarizing function. This can create a rather busy pivot table, so we indicate our favorite way of doing it. Starting with the pivot table in Figure 3.40, drag Total Cost in the top of the PivotTable Fields pane (the item that is already checked) to<br /> the Values area. The bottom part of the PivotTable Fields pane should now appear as in Figure 3.41, and the pivot table should now appear as in Figure 3.42. Note in particular the Values button in the Rows area of Figure 3.41. This button controls the placement of the data in the pivot table. You have a number of options for this button: (1) leave it where it is, (2) drag it above the Time button, (3) drag it to the Columns area, below the Region button, or (4) drag it to the Columns area, above the Region button. You can experiment with these options, but we tend to prefer option (2), which leads to the pivot table in Figure 3.43.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In a similar manner, you can experiment with the buttons in the Values area. However, the effect here is less striking. If you drag the Sum of Total Cost button above the Average of Total Cost button in the field list, the effect is simply to switch the ordering of these summaries in the pivot table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Summarizing by Count</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The field in the Values area, whatever it is, can be summarized by the Count function. This is useful when you want to know, for example, how many of the orders were placed by females in the South. When summarizing by Count, the key is to understand that the field placed in the Values area is irrelevant, so long as you summarize it by the Count function. To illustrate, start with the pivot table in Figure 3.40, where Total Cost is summarized with the Average function. Next, right-click any number in the pivot table, select Value Field Settings, and select the Count from the Summarize Values By options. The default Custom Name you will see in this dialog box, Count of Total Cost, is misleading, because Total Cost has nothing to do with the counts obtained. Therefore, we like to change this Custom Name label to Count. While in the Value Field Settings dialog box, change the number format to Number with zero decimals. The resulting pivot table appears in Figure 3.44. For example, 27 of the 400 orders were placed in the morning in the South, and 115 of the 400 orders were placed in the Northeast. (Do you now see why the counts have nothing to do with Total Cost?) This type of pivot table, with counts for various categories, is the same as the crosstabs discussed in Section 3-2. However, these counts can be created much more quickly with a pivot table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When data are summarized by counts, there are a number of ways they can be displayed. The pivot table in Figure 3.44 shows “raw counts.” Depending on the type of information you want, it might be more useful to display the counts as percentages. Three particular options are typically chosen: as percentages of total, as percentages of row totals, and as percentages of column totals. When shown as percentages of total, the percentages in the table sum to 100%; when shown as percentages of row totals, the percentages in each row sum to 100%; when shown as percentages of column totals, the percentages in each column sum to 100%. Each of these options can be useful, depending on the question you are trying to answer. For example, if you want to know whether the daily pattern of orders varies from region to region, showing the counts as percentages of column totals is useful so that you can compare columns. But if you want to see whether the regional ordering pattern varies by time of day, showing the counts as pecentages of row totals is useful so that you can compare rows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To display the counts as percentages, right-click any number in the pivot table, select Show Values As, and select the option you want. (You can also get to these options from the Show Values As tab in the Value Field Settings dialog box.) For example, if you choose % of Column Totals, the resulting pivot table and corresponding pivot chart appear in Figure 3.45. As you can see by comparing columns, the pattern of regional orders varies somewhat by time of day.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sometimes it is useful to see the raw counts and the percentages. This can be done easily by dragging any variable to the Values area, summarizing it by Count, and displaying it as “Normal.” Figure 3.46 shows one possibility, where we have changed the custom names of the two Count variables to make them more meaningful. Alternatively, the counts and percentages could be shown in two separate pivot tables.</p>

<strong>Pivot Table Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Right-Clicking to Choose Options</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We keep saying to make changes in the Value Field Settings dialog box. However, you can also make changes directly by right-clicking a value in the pivot table. For example, when you right-click a number in the Values area, you see Number Format, Summarize Values By, and Show Values As menu items, among others.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Grouping</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, categories in a Rows or Columns variable can be grouped. This is especially useful when a Rows or Columns variable has many distinct values. Because a pivot table creates a row or column for each distinct value, the results can be unwieldy. We present two possibilities. First, suppose you want to summarize Sum of Total Cost by Date. If you have Excel 2016 or later, the dates will automatically be grouped in some way, probably by month or by quarter. (Prior to Excel 2016, they weren’t grouped at all. You saw a row for each separate date.) In any case, you can right-click any date and select Group. Then you can choose the grouping you prefer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For example, starting with a blank pivot table, we dragged Date to the Rows area and Total Cost to the Values area to get the pivot table in Figure 3.47 (shown in compact layout). By right-clicking any of the month labels and selecting Group, the dialog box in Figure 3.48 opens. The dates are currently grouped by Month and Day, meaning that if you expand any month in column A, you will see a row for each day in that month. If you select Quarter, Month, and Day in Figure 3.48, you will see the pivot table in Figure 3.49 (after collapsing the months).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Pivot Table Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Grouping on Dates</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Suppose you have multiple years of data and you would like a monthly grouping such as January 2017 through December 2019. If you simply select Months in the Grouping dialog box, all of the Januaries, for example, will be lumped together. The trick is to select both Months and Years in the dialog box.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As a second possibility for grouping, suppose you want to see how the average of Total Cost varies by the amount of the highest priced item in the order. You can drag Total Cost to the Values area, summarized by Average, and drag High Item to the Rows area. Because High Item has nearly 400 distinct values, the resulting pivot table is virtually worthless. Therefore, grouping is useful. This time there are no natural groupings as there are for a date variable, so it is up to you to create the groupings. Excel provides the suggested grouping in Figure 3.50, but you can override it. For example, changing the bottom entry to 50 leads to the pivot table in Figure 3.51. Some experimentation is typically required to obtain the grouping that presents the results in the most appropriate way.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By now, we have illustrated the pivot table features that are most commonly used. Be aware, however, that there are many more features available. These include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Showing/hiding subtotals and grand totals (check the Layout options on the Design ribbon)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Dealing with blank rows, that is, categories with no data (right-click any number, choose PivotTable Options, and check the options on the Layout &amp; Format tab)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Displaying the data behind a given number in a pivot table (double-click any number in the Values area to get a new worksheet)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Formatting a pivot table with various styles (check the style options on the Design ribbon)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Moving or renaming pivot tables (check the PivotTable and Action groups on the Analyze ribbon)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Refreshing pivot tables as the underlying data changes (check the Refresh dropdown list on the Analyze ribbon)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Creating pivot table formulas for calculated fields or calculated items (check the Formulas dropdown list on the Analyze ribbon)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Basing pivot tables on external databases (see the next chapter)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Not only are these (and other) features available, but Excel usually provides more than one way to implement them. The suggestions given here are just some of the ways they can be implemented. The key to learning pivot table features is to experiment. There are entire books written about pivot tables, but we don’t recommend them. You can learn a lot more, and a lot more quickly, by experimenting with data such as the Elecmart data. Don’t be afraid to mess up. Pivot tables are very forgiving, and you can always start over.</p>
