To find the least squares line in Excel, there are several ways you can proceed. First, when you superimpose a trend line on a scatterplot of Y versus X, you can request the equation of the line. We did this in Figure 10.12. It shows that the intercept is 25.126 and the slope is 0.7623.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A second method is to use Excel’s built-in INTERCEPT and SLOPE functions. Each of these takes two arguments: the range of the Y-values and the range of the X-values. These (along with other Excel functions to be discussed shortly) appear in Figure 10.14. However, these functions apply only to simple regression, where there is a single X variable. They can’t be used when there are multiple X variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A third method is to use Excel’s LINEST function, also illustrated in Figure 10.14. This is a truly strange function, and we don’t really recommend it, but it is available for simple or multiple regression. As explained in the finished version of the Pharmex file, LINEST is an array function, so you must first select the range for the output, then type the function, and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. As you can see in Figure 10.14, the first row (of five rows) of the LINEST output contains the same slope and intercept as before.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A fourth option is to use the Regression tool in Excel’s built-in Analysis ToolPak add-in. We discussed this add-in briefly in Chapter 1, and a description of it is available at the first author’s website: http://kelley.iu.edu/albrightbooks/Free_downloads .htm. Regression is arguably the best use for Analysis ToolPak, but it still has serious drawbacks, especially when you want to experiment with a number of regression equations. In short, it works, but it can be tedious to use. This is because it requires all the X variables for the regression to be in contiguous columns. (The same is true for the LINEST function.) This can involve a lot of rearrangement of the data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Unfortunately, if you want to perform serious regression with Excel, its built-in tools do not really suffice. For this reason, we will instead rely heavily on StatTools in this chapter and the next chapter. StatTools is easy to use, it is powerful, and it provides the same types of regression output found in virtually all statistical software packages.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To perform the analysis, select Regression from the StatTools Regression and Classification dropdown list. Then fill in the resulting dialog box as shown in Figure 10.15. Specifically, select Multiple as the Regression Type (this type is used for both single and multiple regression in StatTools), and select Promote as the single I variable and Sales as the single D variable. (Here, I and D stand for independent and dependent. Remember that there is always a single D variable, but in multiple regression there can be several I variables.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
We will not use the Wizard at the top of this dialog box, but you should be aware of the three extra Regression tabs, shown in Figures 10.16, 10.17, and 10.18. These three tabs provide a number of options. Specifically, the options in Figure 10.17 allow you to request several diagnostic graphs. We typically request the graph of fitted values versus residuals, but you can request as many as you like.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The regression output includes three parts. The first is the main regression output shown in Figure 10.19. The last two are a scatterplot of residuals and fitted values requested in the regression dialog box and a list of fitted values and residuals, a few of which are shown in Figure 10.20. (The list of fitted values and residuals is part of the output only if you select at least one of the optional graphs in Figure 10.17.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
We will eventually interpret all of the output in Figure 10.19, but for now, we focus on only a small part of it. Specifically, the intercept and slope of the least squares line appear under the Coefficient label in cells B19 and B20. They imply that the equation for the least squares line is<span class="tex-text">\(^{3}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Predicted Sales = 25.1264 + 0.7623 Promote</p>
 <p class="blog">
In many applications, it makes no sense to have the explanatory variable(s) equal to zero. Then the intercept term has no practical or economic meaning.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The regression equation for this example can be interpreted as follows. The slope, 0.7623, indicates that the sales index tends to increase by about 0.76 for each one-unit increase in the promotional expenses index. Alternatively, if two regions are compared, where the second region spends one unit more than the first region, the predicted sales index for the second region is 0.76 larger than the predicted sales index for the first region. The interpretation of the intercept is less important. It is literally the predicted sales index for a region that does zero promotions. However, no region in the sample has anywhere near a zero promotion value. Therefore, in a situation like this, where the range of observed values for the explanatory variable does not include zero, it is best to think of the intercept term as simply an “anchor” for the least squares line that enables predictions of Y values for the range of observed X values.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A shapeless swarm of points in a scatterplot of residuals versus fitted values is typically good news. It means that no regression assumptions are violated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A useful graph in almost any regression analysis is a scatterplot of residuals (on the vertical axis) versus fitted values. This scatterplot for the Pharmex data appears in Figure 10.20 (along with a few of the residuals and fitted values used to create the chart). You typically examine such a scatterplot for any obvious patterns. A good fit not only has small residuals, but it has residuals scattered randomly around zero with no apparent pattern. This appears to be the case for the Pharmex data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3 We always report the left side of the estimated regression equation as the predicted value of the dependent variable. It is not the actual value of the dependent variable because the observations do not all lie on the estimated regression line.</p>
