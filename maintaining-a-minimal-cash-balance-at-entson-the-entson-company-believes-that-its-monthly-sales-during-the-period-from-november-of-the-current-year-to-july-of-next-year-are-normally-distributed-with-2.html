            <p class="blog"><strong>MAINTAINING A MINIMAL CASH BALANCE AT ENTSON</strong></p> <p class="blog">The Entson Company believes that its monthly sales during the period from November of the current year to July of next year are normally distributed with the means and standard deviations given in Table 16.2. Each month Entson incursfixed costs of$250,000. In March taxes of $150,000 and in June taxes of $50,000 must be paid. Dividends of $50,000 must also be paid in June. Entson estimates that its receipts in a given month are a weighted sum of sales from the current month, the previous month, and two months ago, with weights 0.2, 0.6, and 0.2. In symbols, if Rt and St represent receipts and sales in month t, then</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\( R_{t}=0.2 S_{t-2}+0.6 S_{t-1}+0.2 S_{t} \)</span> (16.1)</p> <p class="blog">The materials and labor needed to produce a month’s sales must be purchased one month in advance, and the cost of these averages to 80% of the product’s sales.

The variables for this model appear in Figure 16.18. (See the file Cash Balance Big Picture.xlsx.) Clearly, there is a considerable amount of bookkeeping in this simulation, so it is a good idea to list the events in chronological order that occur each month. We assume the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Entson observes its beginning cash balance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Entson receives interest on its beginning cash balance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Receipts arrive and expenses are paid (including payback of the previous month’s loan, if any, with interest).</p>
 <p class="blog">
• If necessary, Entson takes out a short-term loan.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The final cash balance is observed, which becomes next month’s beginning cash balance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The completed simulation model appears in Figure 16.19. (See the file Cash Balance Finished.xlsx.) It requires the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the blue cells. Note that loans are simulated (in row 42) only for the period from January to June of next year. However, sales figures are required (in row 28) in November and December of the current year to generate receipts for January and February. Also, July sales are required for next year to generate the material and labor costs paid in June.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Actual sales. Generate the sales in row 28 by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskNormal(B6,B7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B28 and copying across.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Beginning cash balance. For January of next year, enter the cash balance with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B19</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D31. Then for the other months, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D43</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell E31 and copy it across row 31. This reflects that the beginning cash balance for one month is the final cash balance from the previous month.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Incomes. Entson’s incomes (interest on cash balance and receipts) are entered in rows 32 and 33. To calculate these, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$24*D31</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT($B$14:$D$14,B28:D28)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells D32 and D33, and copy them across rows 32 and 33. This latter formula, which is based on Equation (16.1), multiplies the fixed weights in row 14 by the relevant sales and adds these products to calculate receipts.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Expenses. Entson’s expenses (fixed costs, taxes and dividends, material and labor costs, and payback of the previous month’s loan) are entered in rows 35 through 39. Calculate these by entering the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D9</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D10</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$17*E28</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D42</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D42*$B$23</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells D35, D36, D37, E38, and E39, respectively, and copying these across rows 35 through 39. (For the loan payback, we are assuming that no loan payback is due in January.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The loan amounts are determined by the random cash inflows and outflows and the fact that Entson’s policy is to maintain a minimum cash balance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Cash balance before loan. Calculate the cash balance before the loan (if any) by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(D31:D33)2_SUM(D35:D39)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D41 and copying it across row 41.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. Amount of loan. If the value in row 41 is below the minimum cash balance ($250,000), Entson must borrow enough to bring the cash balance up to this minimum. Otherwise, no loan is necessary. Therefore, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MAX($B$20_D41,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D42 and copy it across row 42. (You could use an IF function, rather the MAX function, to accomplish the same result.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
8. Final cash balance. Calculate the final cash balance by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=D41+1D42</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D43 and copying it across row 43.</p>
 <p class="blog">
9. Maximum loan, total interest. Calculate the maximum loan from January to June in cell B45 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MAX(D42:I42)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then calculate the total interest paid on all loans in cell B46 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(E39:J39)</p>
 <p class="blog">
10. Output range. In the usual way, designate cells B45 and B46 as output cells. Also, designate the entire range of loans, D42:I42, as an output range. To do this, select this range and click the @RISK Add Output button. It will ask you for a name of the output. We suggest “Loans.” Then a typical formula in this range, such as the formula for cell E42, will be</p>
 <p class="blog">
An @RISK output range, as opposed to a single output cell, allows you to obtain a summary graph that shows the whole simulated range at once. This range is typically a time series.</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskOutput(”Loans”,2)+MAX($B$20_E41,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This indicates that cell E42 is the second cell in the Loans output range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of simulations to 1. Then run the simulation in the usual way.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong><br /> The summary results from the simulation are shown in Figure 16.20. They indicate that the maximum loan varies considerably, from a low of about $470,000 to a high of almost $1.5 million. The average is about $952,000. You can also see that Entson is spending close to $20,000 on average in interest on the loans, although the actual amounts vary considerably from one iteration to another.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can also gain insights from the summary trend graph of the series of loans, shown in Figure 16.21. To obtain this graph, click the fourth button at the bottom of the Results Summary window in Figure 16.20. (This button is also available in any distribution graph window.) This graph clearly shows how the loans vary through time. The middle line is the expected loan amount. The inner bands extend to one standard deviation on either side of the mean, and the outer bands extend to the 5th and 95th percentiles. You can see that the largest loans are required in March and April.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Is it intuitively clear why the required loans peak in March and April? After all, why should Entson need money in months when its sales tend to be relatively high? There are two factors working here. First, Entson has to pay its costs early. For example, it has to pay 80% of its April sales for labor and material expenses in March. Second, most of its receipts arrive late. For example, 80% of its receipts from sales in March are not received until after March. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the timing and amounts of loans are fairly complex. Of course, this is why Entson builds a simulation model in the first place.</p>
