            <p class="blog">THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, SECTION 19.4 Camilla is the regional safety engineer for a chain of franchise-based gasoline and food stores. The home office has had many complaints and several legal actions from employees and customers about slips and falls due to liquids (water, oil, gas, soda, etc.) on concrete surfaces. Corporate<br /> management has authorized each regional engineer to contract locally to apply to all exterior concrete surfaces a newly marketed product that absorbs up to 100 times its own weight in liquid and to charge a home office account for the installation. The authorizing letter to Camilla states that, based upon the.ir simulation and random samples that assume a normal population, the cost of the locally arranged installation should be about $10,000 and almost always is within the range of $8000 to $12,000. Camilla asks you, TJ, an engineering technology graduate, to write a brief but thorough summary about the normal distribution, explain the $8000 to $12,000 range statement, and explain the phrase &#8220;random samples that assume a normal population.&#8221;</p>

You kept this book and a basic engineering statistics text when you graduated, and you have developed the following response to Camilla, using them and the letter from the home office.<br /> Camilla,Here is a brief summary of how the home office appears to be using the normal distribution. As a refresher, I&#8217;ve included a summary of what the normal distribution is all about.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Normal distribution, probabilities, and random samples<br /> The normal distribution is also referred to as the bell-shaped curve, the Gaussian distribution, or the error distribution. It is, by far, the most commonly used probability distribution in all applications. It places exactly one-half of the probability on either side of the mean or expected value. It is used for continuous variables over the entire range<br /> of numbers. The normal is found to accurately predict many types of outcomes, such as IQ values; manufacturing errors about a specified size, volume, weight, etc.; and the distribution of sales revenues, costs, and many other business parameters around a specified mean, which is why it may apply in this situation. The normal distribution, identified by the symbol <span class="tex-text">\(N(μ,σ^2)\)</span>, where μ is the expected<br /> value or mean and <span class="tex-text">\(σ^2\)</span> is the variance, or measure of spread, can be described as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The mean <span class="tex-text">\(μ \)</span> locates the probability distribution (Figure 19-15a), and the spread of the distribution varies with variance (Figure 19-15b), growing wider and flatter for larger variance values.<br /> • When a sample is taken, the estimates are identified as sample mean <span class="tex-text">\( \overline{X} \)</span> for<span class="tex-text">\(μ \)</span> and sample standard deviation s for <span class="tex-text">\(σ\)</span>.<br /> • The normal probability distribution <span class="tex-text">\(f(X)\)</span> for a variable X is quite complicated, because its formula is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi } }\exp \left\{-\left[\frac{(X-\mu )^2}{2\sigma ^2} \right] \right\}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
where exp represents the number e = 2.71828+ and it is raised to the power of the &#8211; [ ] term. In short, if X is given different values, for a given mean <span class="tex-text">\(μ \)</span> and standard deviation <span class="tex-text">\(σ\)</span>, a curve looking like those in Figure 19-15a and b is developed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since f(X) is so unwieldy, random samples and probability statements are developed using a transformation, called the standard normal distribution (SND), which uses the <span class="tex-text">\(μ \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(σ\)</span> (population) or <span class="tex-text">\(\overline{X}\)</span> and s (sample) to compute values of the variable Z.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Population : <span class="tex-text">\(Z=\frac{deviation \ from \ mean}{standard \ deviation} =\frac{X-\mu }{\sigma } \)</span> [19.21]</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sample: <span class="tex-text">\(Z=\frac{X-\overline{X}}{s} \)</span> [19.22]</p>
 <p class="blog">
The SND for Z (Figure 19-15c) is the same as for X, except that it always has a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1, and it is identified by the symbol N(0,1). Therefore, the probability values under the SND curve can be stated exactly. It is always possible to transfer back to the original values from sample data by solving Equation [19.21] for X:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(X=Z\sigma +\mu \)</span> [19.23]</p>
 <p class="blog">
Several probability statements for Z and X are summarized in the following table and are shown on the distribution curve for Z in Figure 19-15c.</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 431px;height: 368px" border="0" width="192" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;width: 48pt" align="left" width="64" height="20">Variable X Range</td> <td style="width: 48pt" align="left" width="64">Probability</td> <td style="width: 48pt" align="left" width="64">Variable Z Range</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="left" height="20"><span class="tex-text">\(\mu +1\sigma \)</span></td> <td style="text-align: center" align="right">0.3413</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">0 to + 1</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="left" height="20"><span class="tex-text">\(\mu ±1\sigma \)</span></td> <td style="text-align: center" align="right">0.6826</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="center">-1 to +1</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="left" height="20"><span class="tex-text">\(\mu +2\sigma \)</span></td> <td style="text-align: center" align="right">0.4773</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">0 to +2</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="left" height="20"><span class="tex-text">\(\mu ±2\sigma \)</span></td> <td style="text-align: center" align="right">0.9546</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">-2 to +2</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="left" height="20"><span class="tex-text">\(\mu +3\sigma \)</span></td> <td style="text-align: center" align="right">0.4987</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">0 to +3</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="left" height="20"><span class="tex-text">\(\mu ±3\sigma \)</span></td> <td style="text-align: center" align="right">0.9974</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">-3 to +3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
As an illustration, probability statements from this tabulation and Figure 19- 15c for X and Z are as follows:<br /> The probability that X is within 20- of its mean is 0.9546.<br /> The probability that Z is within 20- of its mean, which is the same as between the values &#8211; 2 and +2, is also 0.9546.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In order to take a random sample from a normal <span class="tex-text">\(N(μ,σ^2)\)</span> population, a specially prepared table of SND random numbers is used. (Tables of SND values are available in many statistics books.) The numbers are actually values from the Z or N(0,1) distribution<br /> and have values such as -2. 10, + 1.24, etc. Translation from the Z value back to the sample values for X is via Equation [19.23].</p>
 <p class="blog">
Interpretation of the home office memo<br /> The statement that virtually all the local contract amounts should be between $8000 and $ 12,000 may be interpreted as follows: A normal distribution is assumed with a mean of <span class="tex-text">\(μ = \$10,000\)</span>and a standard deviation for <span class="tex-text">\(σ = \$667\)</span>, or a variance of <span class="tex-text">\(σ^2 = (\$667)^2;\)</span> that is, an <span class="tex-text">\(N[\$ 10,000(\$667)^{2}\)</span> distribution is assumed. The value <span class="tex-text">\(σ =\$667\)</span> is calculated using the fact that virtually all the probability (99.74%) is within <span class="tex-text">\(3σ \)</span>of the mean, as stated above. Therefore,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"> <span class="tex-text">\(3σ = \$2000\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( σ = \$667 \)</span> (rounded off)</p>
 <p class="blog">
As an illustration, if six SND random numbers are selected and used to take a sample of size 6 from the normal distribution <span class="tex-text">\(N[\$10,000, (\$667)^{2}]\)</span> , the results are as follows:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 432px;height: 820px" border="0" width="128" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 75.0pt"> <td class="xl65" style="height: 75.0pt;width: 48pt" align="left" width="64" height="100">SND Random Number<br /> Z</td> <td class="xl65" style="width: 48pt" align="left" width="64">X Using Equation [19.23]<br /> X=Zσ+μ</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="right" height="20">-2.1</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">X = (- 2.10)(667) + 10,000 = $8599</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="right" height="20">3.12</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">X = (+3.12)(667) + 10,000 = $12,081</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="right" height="20">-0.23</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">X = (-0.23)(667) + 10,000 = $9847</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="right" height="20">1.24</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">X = (+ 1.24)(667) + 10,000 = $10,827</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="right" height="20">-2.61</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">X = (-2.6 1)(667) + 10,000 = $8259</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt"> <td style="height: 15pt;text-align: center" align="right" height="20">-0.99</td> <td style="text-align: center" align="left">X = (- 0.99)(667) + 10,000 = $9340</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
If we consider this a sample of six typical concrete surfacing contract amounts for sites in our region, the average is $9825 and five of six values are within the range of $8000 and $12,000, with the sixth being only $81 above the upper limit. So we should have no real problems, but it is important that we keep a close watch on the contract<br /> amounts, because the assumption of the normal distribution with a mean of about $10,000 and virtually all contract amounts within ±$2000 of it may not prove to be correct for our region .
