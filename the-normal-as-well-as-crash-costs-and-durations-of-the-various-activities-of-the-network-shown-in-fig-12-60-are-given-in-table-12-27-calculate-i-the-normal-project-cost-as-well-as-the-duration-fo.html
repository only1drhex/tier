(i) First of all, we would consider normal duration of each of the activities and calculate <span class="tex-text">\(T_{E}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(T_{L}\)</span> of the various events. Then we will calculate E.S.T., E.F.T., L.S.T., L.F.T. and Total Float of each of the activities. Subsequently, the critical path will be identified by joining all the critical activities in series through a continuous chain. Then we will compute the project completion time by summing the normal time of all the critical activities. The <span class="tex-text">\(T_{E} \text { and } T_{L}\)</span> of the various events are shown in Fig. 12.61.

 <p class="blog">
From Table 12.28, it is clear that (1–2), (2–5), (5–6) and (6–8) are critical activities as their <span class="tex-text">\(F ^{ t }\)</span> values are zero. Thus, the critical path is 1–2–5-6–8. The project completion time is the sum of normal time of activities (1–2), (2–5), (5–6) and (6–8), i.e., 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 29 days.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total cost of the project when it is completed in normal time, i.e., 29 days, is obtained by adding the direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are obtained by summing the normal cost of each of the activities of the network. Thus, direct costs = 410 + 440 + 610 + 290 + 510 + 280 + 360 + 410 + 490 + 370 + 460 = ₹ 4,630.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Indirect costs are obtained by multiplying the given rate of indirect cost with the project duration. Thus, indirect costs = ₹ 75 * 29 = ₹ 2,175.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the total cost of project when it is completed in normal time = ₹ 4,630 + ₹ 2,175 = ₹ 6,805.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(ii) In order to see the effect of reducing the project duration on the project cost, we need to calculate the cost slope of each of the activities. The cost slope of the activity is calculated by the following relationship:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\text { Cost slope }=\frac{C_{c}-C_{n}}{d_{n}-d_{c}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cost slope values of each of the activities are tabulated in Table 12.29.</p>

 <p class="blog">
In order to reduce project completion duration by 3 days, we have to reduce the duration aof the critical activity that has the lowest cost slope by 3 days. On comparing the cost slopes of the critical activities given in Table 12.29, it is found that activity (2–5) has the lowest cost slope, i.e., ₹ 50 per day, its normal duration is 8 days, crash duration is 5 days and, therefore, 3 days can be reduced from this activity at an additional cost of ₹ 50 * 3 = ₹ 150.</p>
 <p class="blog">
So, the total direct cost would increase to ₹ 4,630 + ₹ 150= ₹ 4,780. When 3 days are reduced from the critical activity (2–5), the project completion time is also reduced by 3 days and it would now be completed in 26 days. Therefore, indirect costs would be ₹ 75 * 26 = ₹ 1,950.</p>
 <p class="blog">
So, the total project cost when the project completion time is reduced by 3 days = ₹ 4780 + ₹ 1950 = ₹ 6,730. The network with reduced duration of activity (2–5) is shown in Fig. 12.62.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(iii) It can be seen from Fig. 12.62 that in addition to path 1–2–5–6–8, path 1–3–5–6–8 also becomes critical as the project completion time through this new path is also 26 days. Thus, two more activities, i.e., (1 3) and (3–5) also become critical.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In order to reduce the project completion time by 5 days, 2 more days are required to be reduced from the duration of critical activities. No further reduction is possible from the duration of activity (2-5). Out of the critical activities (1–2), (5–6), (6–8), (1–3) and (3–5), the cost slope of (1–3) and (5–6) is equal and at the same time the lowest also. Activity (5–6) is selected for reduction purpose as it is possible to reduce 2 days from its duration and once duration is reduced both paths, i.e., 1–2–5–6–8 and 1–3–5–6–8 remain critical. The additional cost of reducing the project completion time by 2 days would be ₹ 60 * 2 = ₹ 120. The additional cost of reducing the project completion time by 5 days = additional cost of reducing time by 3 days + additional cost of reducing time by 2 days = ₹ 150 + ₹ 120 = ₹ 270. The direct cost of reducing project completion time by 5 days = ₹ 4,630 + ₹ 270 = ₹ 4,900. Indirect costs when the project completion time is reduced by 5 days = ₹ 75 * 24 = ₹ 1,800. Thus, the total cost when the project completion time is reduced by 5 days = ₹ 4,900 + ₹ 1,800 = ₹ 6,700.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The network with reduced duration of activity (5–6) is shown in Fig. 12.63.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From Fig. 12.64, it can be seen that paths 1–2–5–6–8 and 1–3–5–6–8 are still critical paths as the project completion time through these paths is 24 days and, therefore, no new activity has become critical. In order to reduce project completion time by 6 days, 1 more days is required to be reduced from the duration of critical activities. There is a further possibility of reducing the duration of activity (5–6) by 1 day. So, 1 day is reduced from the duration of activity (5–6) with an additional cost of ` 60. The additional cost of reducing project completion time by 6 days = additional cost of reducing time by 3 days + additional cost of reducing time by 2 days + additional cost of reducing time by 1 day = ₹ 150 + ₹ 120 + ₹ 60 = ₹ 330. The direct cost of reducing project completion time by 6 days = ₹ 4,630 + ₹ 330 = ₹ 4,960. Indirect costs when the project completion time is reduced by 6 days = ₹ 75 * 23 = ₹ 1,725. Thus, the total cost when project completion time is reduced by 6 days = ₹ 4,960 + ₹ 1,725 = ₹ 6,685.</p>

The network with reduced duration of activity (5-6) is shown in Fig. 12.64.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From Fig. 12.64 it can be seen that in addition to paths 1–2–5–6–8 and 1–3–5–6–8, the path 1–2–6–8 has also become critical as the project completion time through all these three paths is 23 days. Thus, one more activity, i.e., (2–6) has also become a critical activity. In order to reduce project completion time by 7 days, 1 more day is required to be reduced from the duration of critical activities. No further reduction is possible from the duration of activity (5–6). Out of the critical activities (1–2), (6–8), (1–3), (3–5) and (2–6), the cost slope of (1–3) is the lowest and there is a possibility of reducing its duration by 1 day at an additional cost of ` 60. However, if 1 day is reduced from the duration of activity (1–3), 1 day must also be reduced from the duration of activity (1–2) so as to achieve project completion time of 22 days through all these three critical paths. Thus, additional cost of reducing project completion time by 1 day = additional cost of reducing the duration of activity (1–3) by 1 day + additional cost of reducing the duration of activity (1–2) by 1 day = ₹ 60 + ₹ 120 = ₹ 180. Thus, the direct cost of reducing the project duration by 7 days = ₹ 4,630 + ₹ 150 + ₹ 120 + ₹ 60 + ₹ 180 = ₹ 5,140. Indirect cost, when the project completion time is reduced by 7 days = ₹ 75 * 22 = ₹ 1650. Thus, the total cost when project completion time is reduced by 7 days = ₹ 5,140 + ₹ 1,650 6,790.</p>

That is one more option that needs to be explored. Although the cost slope of critical activity (6–8) is higher than activity (1–3), but if 1 day is reduced from the duration of activity (6–8), then all three paths, i.e., 1 2–5–6–8, 1–3–5–6–8 and 1–2–6–8 still remain critical. Thus, the additional cost of reducing duration of activity (6-8) by 1 day i ₹ 80. The additional cost of reducing project completion time by 7 days = ₹ 150 + ₹ 120 + ₹ 60 + ₹ 80 = ₹ 410 Direct cost of the project when the project completion time is reduced by 7 days = ₹ 4,630 + ₹ 410 = ₹ 5,040. Indirect cost of project when the project completion time is reduced by 7 days = ₹ 75 * 22 = ₹ 1,650. So, the total cost when the project completion time is reduced by 7 days = ₹ 5,040 + ₹ 1,650 = ₹ 6,690. This option gives a relatively lower total cost and, therefore, it should be considered as it provides a better solution. Finally, the total cost when the project completion time is reduced by 7 days is ₹ 6,690. The total cost when the project completion time when reduced by different durations is summarized in Table 12.30.</p>

From Table 12.30, it is clear that total cost of project when its duration is reduced by 6 days ais the minimum and in the event of either increase or decrease in the project duration the total project cost increases. Thus, the optimum solution to this problem is project completion time = 23 days and total project cost= ₹ 6,685.</p>
