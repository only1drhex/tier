            <p class="blog"><strong>OVERBOOKING BY AIRLINES </strong></p> <p class="blog">This example presents a simplified version of calculations used by airlines when they overbook flights. They realize that a certain percentage of ticketed passengers will cancel at the last minute. Therefore, to avoid empty seats, they sell more tickets than there are seats, hoping that just about the right number of passengers show up. We assume that the no-show rate is 10%. In binomial terms, we assume that each ticketed passenger, independently of the others, shows up with probability 0.90 and cancels with probability 0.10.</p> <p class="blog">For a flight with 200 seats, the airline wants to see how sensitive various probabilities are to the number of tickets it issues. In particular, it wants to calculate (a) the probability that more than 205 passengers show up, (b) the probability that more than 200 passengers show up, (c) the probability that at least 195 seats are filled, and (d) the probability that at least 190 seats are filled. The first two of these are “bad” events from the airline’s perspective; they mean that some customers will be bumped from the flight. The last two events are “good” in the sense that the airline wants most of the seats to be occupied.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To assess the benefits and drawbacks of airline overbooking.</p>

To solve the airline’s problem, we use the BINOM.DIST function and a data table. The solution appears in Figure 5.19. (See the file Airline Overbooking Finished.xlsx.) For any number of tickets issued in cell B6, the required probabilities are calculated in row 10. For example, the formulas in cells B10 and D10 are</p>
 <p class="blog">
=1-BINOM.DIST(205,NTickets,1-PNoShow,TRUE)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=1-BINOM.DIST(194,NTickets,1-PNoShow,TRUE)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the condition “more than” requires a slightly different calculation from “at least.” The probability of more than 205 is one minus the probability of less than or equal to 205, whereas the probability of at least 195 is one minus the probability of less than or equal to 194. Also, note that a passenger who shows up is called a success. Therefore, the third argument of each BINOM.DIST function is one minus the no-show probability.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To see how sensitive these probabilities are to the number of tickets issued, a one-way data table was created at the bottom of the spreadsheet. It is one-way because there is only one input, the number of tickets issued, even though four output probabilities are tabulated. (To create the data table, list several possible numbers of tickets issued along the side in column A and create links in row 14 to the probabilities in row 10. That is, enter the formula =B10 in cell B14 and copy it across row 14. Then form a data table using the range A14:E24, no row input cell, and column input cell B6.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results are as expected. As the airline issues more tickets, there is a larger chance of having to bump passengers from the flight, but there is also a larger chance of filling most seats. In reality, the airline has to make a trade-off between these two, taking its various costs and prices into account.</p>
