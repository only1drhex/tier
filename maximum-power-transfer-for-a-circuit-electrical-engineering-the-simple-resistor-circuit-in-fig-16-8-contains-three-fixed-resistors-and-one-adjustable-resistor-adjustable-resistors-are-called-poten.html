An expression for power for the circuit can be derived from Kirchhoff’s laws as</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P(R_{a})=\frac{\left[\frac{VR_{3}R_{a}}{R_{1}(R_{a}+R_{2}+R_{3})+R_{3}R_{2}+R_{3}R_{2}} \right]^{2} }{R_{a}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
Substituting the parameter values gives the plot shown in Fig. 16.9. Notice that a maximum power transfer occurs at a resistance of about <span class="tex-text">\(16 \Omega.\)</span><br /> We will solve this problem in two ways with the Excel spreadsheet. First, we will employ trial-and-error and the Solver option. Then, we will develop a Visual Basic macro program to perform the sensitivity analysis.<br /> (a) An Excel spreadsheet to implement Eq (16.11) is shown in Fig. 16.10. As indicated, Eq. (16.11) can be entered into cell B9. Then the value of Ra (cell B8) can be varied in a trial-and-error fashion until a minimum drag was determined. For this example, the result is a power of 30.03 W and a potentiometer setting of <span class="tex-text">\(R_a = 16.44 \Omega\)</span>. A superior approach involves using the Solver option from the spreadsheet’s Data tab. When Solver is selected, a dialogue box will be displayed, querying you for pertinent information. The pertinent cells of the Solver dialogue box would be filled out as</p>
 <p class="blog">
When the OK button is selected, a dialogue box will open with a report on the success of the operation. For the present case, the Solver obtains the same correct solution shown in Fig. 16.10.<br /> (b) Now, although the foregoing approach is excellent for a single evaluation, it is not convenient for cases where multiple optimizations would be employed. Such would be the case for the second part of this application, where we are interested in determining how the maximum power varies for different voltage settings. Of course, the Solver could be invoked multiple times for different parameter values, but this would be inefficient. A preferable course would involve developing a macro function to come up with the optimum.<br /> Such a function is shown in Fig. 16.11. Notice how closely it resembles the goldensection-search pseudocode previously presented in Fig. 13.5. In addition, notice that a function must also be defined to compute power according to Eq. (16.11).<br /> An Excel spreadsheet utilizing this macro to evaluate the sensitivity of the solution to voltage is given in Fig. 16.12. A column of values is set up that spans the range of V’s (that is, from 45 to 105 V). A function call to the macro is written in cell B9 that references the adjacent value of V (the 45 in A9). In addition, the other parameters in the function argument are also included. Notice that, whereas the reference to V is relative, the references to the lower and upper guesses and the resistances are absolute (that is, they include a leading $). This was done so that when the formula is copied down, the absolute references stay fixed, whereas the relative reference corresponds to the voltage in the same row. A similar strategy is used to place Eq. (16.11) in cell C9.<br /> When the formulas are copied downward, the result is as shown in Fig. 16.12. The maximum power can be plotted to visualize the impact of voltage variations. As seen in Fig. 16.13, the power increases with V.<br /> The results for the corresponding potentiometer settings <span class="tex-text">\((R_a)\)</span> are more interesting.<br /> The spreadsheet indicates that the same setting, <span class="tex-text">\(16.44 \Omega\)</span>, results in maximum power.<br /> Such a result might be difficult to intuit based on casual inspection of Eq. (16.11).</p>
