The sample data appear in Figure 9.14, where each width is measured to three decimal places. (See the file Testing Normality Finished.xlsx.) A histogram of the widths is also shown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To run the test, select Chi-Square Test from the StatTools Normality Tests dropdown list, which leads to a dialog box where you can either specify the bins for a histogram or you can accept StatTools’s default bins. For now, do the latter.<span class="tex-text">\(^{4}\)</span> The resulting histograms in Figure 9.15 provide visual evidence of the goodness of fit. The left bars represent the observed frequencies(the <span class="tex-text">\(O_{i} s\)</span>), and the right bars represent the expected frequencies for a normal distribution (the <span class="tex-text">\(E_{i} s\)</span>). The normal fit to the data appears to be quite good.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The StatTools output in Figure 9.16 confirms this statistically. Each value in column E is an <span class="tex-text">\(E_{i}\)</span>, calculated as the total number of observations multiplied by the normal probability of being in the corresponding category. Column F contains the individual <span class="tex-text">\( \left(O_{i}-E_{i}\right)^{2} / E_{i}\)</span> terms, and cell B11 contains their sum, the chi-square test statistic. The corresponding p-value in cell B12 is 0.5206.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This large p-value provides no evidence whatsoever of non-normality. It implies that if this procedure were repeated on many random samples, each taken from a population known to be normal, a fit at least this poor would occur in over 50% of the samples. Stated differently, fewer than 50% of the fits would be better than the one observed here. Therefore, the manager can feel comfortable in making a normal assumption for this population.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We make several comments about this chi-square procedure. First, the test does depend on which (and how many) bins you use for the histogram. Reasonable choices are likely to lead to the same conclusion, but this is not guaranteed. Second, the test is not very effective unless the sample size is large: at least 80 or 100, say. Only then can you begin to see the true shape of the histogram and judge accurately whether it is normal. Finally, the test tends to be too sensitive if the sample size is really large. In this case any little “bump” on the observed histogram is likely to lead to a conclusion of non-normality. This is one more example of practical versus statistical significance. With a large sample size you might be able to reject normality with a high degree of certainty, but the practical difference between the observed and normal histograms could very well be unimportant.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Lilliefors test is based on a comparison of the cdf from the data and a normal cdf.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The chi-square test of normality is an intuitive one because it is based on histograms. However, it suffers from the first two points discussed in the previous paragraph. In particular, it is not as powerful as other available tests. This means that it is often unable to distinguish between normal and non-normal distributions, and hence it often fails to reject the null hypothesis of normality when it should be rejected. A more powerful test is called the Lilliefors<span class="tex-text">\( \text { test. }^{5} \)</span>This test is based on the cumulative distribution function 1cdf2, which shows the probability of being less than or equal to any particular value. Specifically, the Lilliefors test compares two cdfs: the cdf from a normal distribution and the cdf corresponding to the given data. This latter cdf, called the empirical cdf , shows the fraction of observations less than or equal to any particular value. If the data come from a normal distribution, the normal and empirical cdfs should be quite close. Therefore, the Lilliefors test compares the maximum vertical distance between the two cdfs and compares it to specially tabulated values. If this maximum vertical distance is sufficiently large, the null hypothesis of normality can be rejected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To run the Lilliefors test for the Width variable in Example 9.6, select Lilliefors Test from the StatTools Normality Tests dropdown list. StatTools then shows the numerical outputs in Figure 9.17 and the corresponding graph in Figure 9.18 of the normal and empirical cdfs. The numeric output indicates that the maximum vertical distance between the two curves is 0.0513. It also provides a number of “CVal” values for comparison. If the test statistic is larger than any of these, the null hypothesis of normality can be rejected at the corresponding significance level. In this case, however, the test statistic is relatively<br /> small—not nearly large enough to reject the normal hypothesis at any of the usual significance levels. This conclusion agrees with the one based on the chi-square goodness-of-fit test (as well as the closeness of the two curves in Figure 9.18). Nevertheless, you should be aware that the two tests do not agree on all data sets.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We conclude this section with a popular, but informal, test of normality. This is based on a plot called a quantile-quantile (or Q-Q) plot. Although the technical details for forming this plot are somewhat complex, it is basically a scatterplot of the standardized values from the data set versus the values that would be expected if the data were perfectly normally distributed (with the same mean and standard deviation as in the data set). If the data are, in fact, normally distributed, the points in this plot tend to cluster around a 45° line. Any large deviation from a 45° line signals some type of non-normality. Again, however, this is not a formal test of normality. A Q-Q plot is usually used only to obtain a general idea of whether the data are normally distributed and, if they are not, what type of non-normality exists. For example, if points on the right of the plot are well above a 45° line, this is an indication that the largest observations in the data set are larger than would be expected from a normal distribution. Therefore, these points might be high-end outliers and/or a signal of positive skewness.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If data are normally distributed, the points on the corresponding Q-Q plot should be close to a 45° line.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To obtain a Q-Q plot for the Width variable in Example 9.6, select Q-Q Normal Plot from the StatTools Normality Tests dropdown list and check each option at the bottom of the dialog box. The Q-Q plot for the Width data in Example 9.6 appears in Figure 9.19. Although the points in this Q-Q plot do not all lie exactly on a 45° line, they are about as close to doing so as can be expected from real data. Therefore, there is no reason tom question the normal hypothesis for these data—the same conclusion as from the chi-square and Lilliefors tests. (Note that in the StatTools Q-Q plot dialog box, you can elect to plot standardized Q-values. This option was used in Figure 9.19. The plot with unstandardized Q-values, not shown here, provides virtually the same information. The only difference is in the scale of the vertical axis.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 You might try defining the bins differently and rerunning the test. The category definitions can make a difference in the results. This is a minor disadvantage of the chi-square test.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5 This is actually a special case of the more general and widely known Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (or K-S) test.</p>
