            <p class="blog">Ordering Calendars at Walton Boo kstore<br /> In August, Walton Bookstore must decide how many of next year’s nature calendars to order. Each calendar costs the bookstore $7.50 and sells for $10. After January 1, all unsold calendars will be returned to the publisher for a refund of $2.50 per calendar. Walton believes that the number of calendars it can sell by January 1 follows some probability distribution with mean 200. Walton believes that ordering to the average demand, that is, ordering 200 calendars, is a good decision. Is it?<br /> <strong>Objective</strong> To illustrate the difference between a deterministic model with a best guess for uncertain inputs and a simulation model that incorporates uncertainty explicitly.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The monetary values are straightforward. The mean demand is probably an estimate based on historical demands for similar calendars.</p>

The variables for this model are shown in Figure 10.22. (See the file Ordering Calendars Big Picture.xlsx.) Note that we use a green rectangle with a rounded top for uncertain quantities. (For most of the rest of this chapter, you can refer back to this figure.) An order quantity is determined and demand is then observed. The ordering cost is based on the order quantity, the revenue is based on the smaller of the order quantity and demand, and there is a refund if demand is less than the order quantity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A deterministic version of the model appears in Figure 10.23. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; Flaw of Averages Finished.xlsx.) Assuming the best guess for demand, Walton orders to this average value, and it appears that the company’s best guess for profit is $500. (The formulas in cells B16:F16 are straightforward. Anticipating that the order quantity and demand will not always be equal, they are = B9, =B5*MIN(B9,B12), =B4*B12, =B6*MAX(B12-B9,0), and =C16-D16+E16.) Before reading further, do you believe that the average profit will be $500 when uncertainty in demand is introduced explicitly (and the company still orders 200 calendars)? Think what happens to profit when demand is less than 200 and when it is greater than 200. Are these two cases symmetric?</p>
 <p class="blog">
We now contrast this with a simulation model where the demand in cell B9 is replaced by a random number. For this example, we assume that demand is normally distributed with mean 200 and standard deviation 40, although these specific assumptions are not crucial for the qualitative aspects of the example. All you need to do is enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(RISKNORMAL(200,40),0) in cell B9, where the ROUND function has been used to round to the nearest integer. Now the model appears as in Figure 10.24.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The random demand in cell B9 is now live, as are its dependents in row 16, so each time you press the F9 key, you get a new demand and associated profit. (This assumes that the @RISK “dice” button is toggled so that it is colored, its “random” setting. More will be said about this setting later in the chapter.) Do you get about $500 in profit on average? Absolutely not! The situation isn’t symmetric. The largest profit you can get is $500, which occurs about half the time, whenever demand is greater than 200. A typical such situation appears in the figure, where the excess demand of 54 is simply lost. However, when demand is less than 200, the profit is less than $500, and it keeps decreasing as demand decreases. We ran @RISK with 1000 iterations (which will be explained in detail in section 10.5) and found the resulting histogram of 1000 simulated profits shown in Figure 10.25. The large spike on the right is due to the cases where demand is 200 or more and profit is $500. All the little spikes to the left are where demand is less than 200 and profit is less than $500, sometimes considerably less. You can see on the right that the mean profit, the average<br /> of the 1000 simulated profits, is only about $380, well less than the $500 suggested by the deterministic model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The point of this simple example is that a deterministic model can be very misleading. In particular, the output from a deterministic model that uses best guesses for uncertain inputs is not necessarily equal to, or even close to, the average of the output from a simulation. This is exactly what “the flaw of averages” means.</p>
