            <p class="blog"><strong>FINDING AN OPTIMAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY AT BARNEY-JONES </strong></p> <p class="blog">At the present time, the beginning of year 1, Barney-Jones Investment Corporation has $100,000 to invest for the next four years. There are five possible investments, labeled A through E. The timing of cash outflows and cash inflows for these investments is somewhat irregular. For example, to take part in investment A, cash must be invested at the beginning of year 1, and for every dollar invested, there are returns of $0.50 and $1.00 at the beginnings of years 2 and 3. Information for the other investments follows, where all returns are per dollar invested:<span class="tex-text">\(^{10}\)</span></p> <p class="blog">• Investment B: Invest at the beginning of year 2, receive returns of $0.50 and $1.00 at the beginnings of years 3 and 4</p> <p class="blog">• Investment C: Invest at the beginning of year 1, receive return of $1.20 at the beginning of year 2</p> <p class="blog">• Investment D: Invest at the beginning of year 4, receive return of $1.90 at the beginning of year 5</p> <p class="blog">• Investment E: Invest at the beginning of year 3, receive return of $1.50 at the beginning of year 4</p> <p class="blog">We assume that any amounts can be invested in these strategies and that the returns are the same for each dollar invested. However, to create a diversified portfolio, Barney-Jones wants to limit the amount put into any investment to $75,000. The company wants an investment strategy that maximizes the amount of cash on hand at the beginning of year 5. At the beginning of any year, it can invest only cash on hand, which includes returns from previous investments. Any cash not invested in any year can be put in a short-term money market account that earns 3% annually.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To develop an optimization model that relates investment decisions to total ending cash, and to use Solver to find the strategy that maximizes ending cash and invests no more than a given amount in any one investment.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">There is no mystery here. We assume that the terms of each investment are spelled out, so that Barney-Jones knows<br /> exactly when money must be invested and what the amounts and timing of returns will be. Of course, this would not be the case for many real-world investments, such as money put into the stock market, where considerable uncertainty is involved. We consider one such example of investing with uncertainty when we study portfolio optimization in Section 14-8.</p> <p class="blog">10 You might criticize this model for assuming known returns in future years. If the returns are actually uncertain with given probability distributions, the RISKOptimizer tool in @RISK (part of Palisade’s DecisionTools Suite) can be used to find the investment strategy that maximizes the expected return. However, we won’t discuss this possibility here.</p>

The variables and constraints for this investment model are shown in Figure 14.33. (See the file Investing Big Picture.xlsx.) On the surface, this problem appears to be very straightforward. You must decide how much to invest in the available investments at the beginning of each year, using only the cash available. If you try modeling this problem without our help, however, we suspect that you will have some difficulty. It took us a few tries to get a model that is easy to read and generalizes to other similar investment problems. Note that the second constraint in the table can be expressed in two ways. It can be expressed as shown, where the cash on hand after investing is nonnegative, or it can be expressed as “cash invested in any year must be less than or equal to cash on hand at the beginning of that year.” These are equivalent. The one you choose is a matter of taste.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are often multiple equivalent ways to state a constraint. You can choose the one that is most natural for you.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for this investment problem appears in Figure 14.34. (See the file Investing Finished.xlsx.) To set up this spreadsheet, proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs and range names. As usual, enter the given inputs in the blue cells and name the ranges indicated. Pay particular attention to the two shaded tables. This is probably the first model you have encountered where model development is affected significantly by the way you enter the inputs, specifically, the information about the investments. We suggest separating cash outflows from cash inflows, as shown in the two ranges B11:F14 and B19:F23. The top table indicates when investments can be made, where a blank (equivalent to a 0) indicates no possible investment, and $1.00 indicates a dollar of investment. The bottom table then indicates the amounts and timing of returns per dollar invested.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The two input tables allow you to create copyable SUMPRODUCT formulas for cash outflows and inflows. Careful spreadsheet planning can often greatly simplify the necessary formulas.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Investment amounts. Enter any trial values in the Dollars_invested range. This range contains the decision variable cells. Also put a link to the maximum investment amount per investment by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$5</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B28 and copying it across.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Cash balances and flows. The key to the model is the section in rows 32 through 36. For each year, you need to calculate the beginning cash held from the previous year, the returns from investments that are due in that year, the investments made in that year, and cash balance after investments. Begin by entering the initial cash in cell B32 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B4</p>
 <p class="blog">
Moving across, calculate the return due in year 1 in cell C32 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B19:F19,Dollars_invested)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Admittedly, no returns come due in year 1, but this formula can be copied down column C for other years. Next, calculate the total amount invested in year 1 in cell D32 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B11:F11,Dollars_invested)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now find the cash balance after investing in year 1 in cell E32 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B321C32-D32</p>
 <p class="blog">
The only other required formula is the formula for the cash available at the beginning of year 2. Because any cash not invested earns 3% interest, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=E32*(11$B$6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B33. This formula, along with those in cells C32, D32, and E32, can now be copied down. (The zeros in column G are entered manually as a reminder of the nonnegativity constraint on cash after investing.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Ending cash. The ending cash at the beginning of year 5 is the sum of the amount in the money market and any returns that come due in year 5. Calculate this sum with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(B36:C36)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Always look at the Solver solution for signs of implausibility. This can often help you spot an error in your model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B38. (Note: Here is the type of error to watch out for. We originally failed to calculate the return in cell C36 and mistakenly used the beginning cash in cell B36 as the objective cell. We realized our error when the optimal solution called for no money in investment D, which is clearly an attractive investment. The moral is that you can often catch errors by looking at the plausibility of the results.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Review of the Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Take a careful look at this model and how it has been set up. There are undoubtedly alternative ways to model this problem, but the attractive feature of this model is the way the tables of inflows and outflows in rows 11 through 14 and 19 through 23 create copyable formulas for returns and investment amounts in columns C and D of rows 32 through 35. This same model setup, with only minor modifications, will work for any set of investments, regardless of the timing of investments and their returns. This is a quality you should strive for in your spreadsheet models: generalizability.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
To find the optimal investment strategy, fill in the main Solver dialog box as shown in Figure 14.35. Note that the explicit nonnegativity constraint is necessary, even though the Non-Negative option is checked. Again, this is because the Non-Negative option covers only the decision variable cells. If you want other output cells to be nonnegative, you must constrain them explicitly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution appears in Figure 14.34. Let’s follow the cash. The company spends all its cash in year 1 on the two available investments, A and C ($64,286 in A, $35,714 in C). A total of $75,000 in returns from these investments is available in year 2, and it is all invested in investment B. At the beginning of year 3, a total of $101,786 is available from investment A and B returns, and $75,000 of this is invested in investment E. This leaves $26,786 for the money market, which grows to $27,589 at the beginning of year 4. In addition, returns totaling $187,500 from investments B and E come due in year 4. Of this total cash of $215,089, $75,000 is invested in investment D, and the rest, $140,089, is put in the money market. The return from investment D, $142,500, plus the money available from the money market, $144,292, equals the final cash in the objective cell, $286,792.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sensitivity Analysis<br /> A close look at the optimal solution in Figure 14.34 indicates that Barney-Jones is penalizing itself by imposing a maximum of $75,000 per investment. This upper limit is forcing the company to put cash into the money market fund, despite this fund’s low rate of return. Therefore, a natural sensitivity analysis is to see how the optimal solution changes as this maximum value changes. You can perform this sensitivity analysis with a one-way SolverTable, shown in Figure 14.36.<span class="tex-text">\(^{11}\)</span> The maximum in cell B5 is the input cell, varied from $75,000 to $225,000 in increments of $25,000, and the optimal decision variable cells and objective cell are outputs. As you can see, the final cash (column G) grows steadily as the maximum allowable investment amount increases. This is because the company can take greater advantage of the attractive investments and put less in the money market account.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can go one step further with the two-way SolverTable in Figure 14.37. Now both the maximum investment amount and the money market rate are inputs, and the maximum amount ever put in the money market fund is the single output. Because this latter amount is not calculated in the spreadsheet model, you need to calculate it with the formula =MAX(Cash_after_investing) in an unused cell before using it as the output cell for SolverTable. In every case, even with a large maximum investment amount and a low money market rate, the company puts some money into the money market account. The reason is simple. Even when the maximum investment amount is $225,000, the company evidently has more cash than this to invest at some point (probably at the beginning of year 4). Therefore, it will have to put some of it in the money market.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To perform sensitivity on an output variable not calculated explicitly in your spreadsheet model, calculate it in some unused portion of the spreadsheet before running SolverTable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
11 Because Solver’s sensitivity reports do not help answer our specific sensitivity questions in this example or the next example, we discuss only SolverTable results.</p>
