            <p class="blog">In-flight telephones provided at airline passenger seats are an expected service by many customers. Delta Airlines knows it will have to replace 15,000 to 24,000 units in the next few years on its Boeing 737, 757, and some 777 aircraft. Four optional data-handling features which build upon one another are available from the manufacturer, but at an added cost per unit. Besides costing more, the higher-end options (e.g., satellite-based plug-in video service) are estimated to have longer lives before the next replacement is forced by new, advanced features expected by flyers. All four options are expected to boost annual revenues by varying amounts. Figure 8-7 spreadsheet rows 2 through 6 include all the estimates for the four options.</p> <p class="blog">(a) Using MARR = 15%, perform ROR, PW, and AW evaluations to select the one level of options which is the most promising economically.<br /> (b) If more than one level of options can be selected, consider the four that are described as independent projects. If no budget limitations are considered at this time, which options are acceptable if the MARR is increased to 20% when more than one option may be implemented?</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2022/01/8.7-768x611.png"></div>

Solution by Computer<br /> (a) The spreadsheet (Figure 8-7) is divided into six sections:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Section 1 (rows 1, 2): MARR value and the alternative names (A through D) in increasing order of initial cost.<br /> Section 2 (rows 3 to 6): Per-unit net cash flow estimates for each alternative. These are revenue alternatives with unequal lives.<br /> Section 3 (rows 7 to 20): Actual and incremental cash flows are displayed here.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Section 4 (rows 21 , 22): Because these are all revenue alternatives, <span class="tex-text">\( i^{*}\)</span> values are determined by the IRR function. If an alternative passes the MARR test (<span class="tex-text">\( i^{*} &gt; 15\%)\)</span>, it is retained and a column is added to the right of its actual cash flows so the incremental cash flows can be determined. Columns F and H were inserted to make space for the incremental evaluations. Alternative A does not pass the <span class="tex-text">\( i^{*}\)</span> test.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Section 5 (rows 23 to 25): The IRR functions display the <span class="tex-text">\( \Delta i^{*}\)</span> values in columns F and H. Comparison of C to B takes place over the LCM of 12 years. Since <span class="tex-text">\( \Delta i^{*}_{C-B} = 19.42\% &gt; 15\%,\)</span> eliminate B; alternative C is the new defender and D is the next challenger. The final comparison of D to Cover 12 years results in <span class="tex-text">\( \Delta i^{*}_{D-C} = 11.23\% &lt; 15\%\)</span>, so D is eliminated. Alternative C is the chosen one.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Section 6 (rows 26 to 29): These include the AW and PW analyses. The AW value over the life of each alternative is calculated using the PMT function at the MARR with an embedded NPV function. Also, the PW value is determined from the AW value for 12 years using the PV function. For both measures, alternative C has the numerically largest value, as expected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Conclusion: All methods result in the same, correct choice of alternative C.<br /> (b) Since each option is independent of the others, and there is no budget limitation at this time, each <span class="tex-text">\( i^{*}\)</span> value in row 21 of Figure 8- 7 is compared to MARR = 20%. This is a comparison of each option with the do-nothing alternative. Of the four, options<br /> B and C have <span class="tex-text">\( i^{*}&gt; 20\%\)</span>. They are acceptable; the other two are not.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comment<br /> In part (a), we should have applied the two multiple-root sign tests to the incremental cash flow series for the C-to-B comparison. The series it self has three sign changes, and the cumulative cash flow series starts negatively and also has three sign changes. Therefore, up to three real-number roots may exist. The IRR function is applied in cell F23 to obtain <span class="tex-text">\( \Delta i^{*}_{C-B} = 19.42\%\)</span> without using the net-investment procedure. This action assumes that the reinvestment assumption of 19.42% for positive net-investment cash flows is a reasonable one. If the MARR = 15%, or some other earning rate, were more appropriate, the net-investment procedure would have to be applied to determine the composite rate, which would be different from 19.42%. Depending upon the reinvestment rate chosen, alternative<br /> C mayor may not be incrementally justified against B. Here, the assumption is made that the <span class="tex-text">\( \Delta i^{*} \)</span> value is reasonable, so C is justified.</p>
