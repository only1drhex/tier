            <p class="blog"><strong>NEW PRODUCT DECISIONS AT ACME </strong></p> <p class="blog">The Acme Company must decide whether to market a new product. As in many new-product situations, there is considerable uncertainty about the eventual success of the product. The product is currently part way through the development process, and some fixed development costs have already been incurred. If the company decides to continue development and then market the product, there will be additional fixed costs, and they are estimated to be $6 million. If the product is marketed, its unit margin (selling price minus variable cost) will be $18. Acme classifies the possible market results as “great,” “fair,” and “awful,” and it estimates the probabilities of these outcomes to be 0.45, 0.35, and 0.20, respectively. Finally, the company estimates that the corresponding sales volumes (in thousands of units sold) from these three outcomes are 600, 300, and 90, respectively. Assuming that Acme is an EMV maximizer, should it finish development and then market the product, or should it stop development at this point and abandon the product?<span class="tex-text">\(^{4}\)</span></p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use the EMV criterion to help Acme decide whether to go ahead with the product.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">Acme’s cost accountants should be able to estimate the monetary inputs: the fixed costs and the unit margin. (Any fixed costs already incurred are sunk and therefore have no relevance to the current decision.) The uncertain sales volume is really a continuous variable but, as in many decision problems, Acme has replaced the continuum by three representative possibilities. The assessment of the probabilities and the sales volumes for these three possibilities might be based partly on historical data and market research, but they almost surely have a subjective component.</p> <p class="blog">4 To keep the model simple, we ignore taxes and the time value of money.</p>

The elements of the decision problem appear in Figure 6.4. (See the files New Product Decisions &#8211; Single-Stage 1a Finished.xlsx and New Product Decisions &#8211; Single-Stage 1b Finished.xlsx.) If the company decides to stop development and abandon the product, there are no payoffs, costs, or uncertainties; the EMV is $0. (Actually, this isn’t really an expected value; it is a sure $0.) On the other hand, if the company proceeds with the product, it incurs the fixed cost and receives $18 for every unit it sells. The probability distribution of sales volume given in the problem statement appears in columns A to C, and each sales volume is multiplied by the unit margin to obtain the net revenues in column D. Finally, the formula for the EMV in cell B12 is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(D8:D10,B8:B10)-B4</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because this EMV is positive, slightly over $1 million, the company is better off marketing the product than abandoning it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As before, a decision tree is probably overkill for this problem, but it is shown in Figure 6.5. (All monetary and sales volumes are shown in thousands.) This tree indicates one of at least two equivalent ways to show the EMV calculations. The values at the end nodes ignore the fixed cost, which is instead shown under the decision branch as a negative number. Therefore, the 7074 value above the probability node is the expected net revenue, not including the fixed cost. Then the fixed cost is subtracted from this to obtain the 1074 value above the decision node.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 6.6 shows an equivalent tree, where the fixed cost is still shown under the decision branch but is subtracted from each end node. Now the EMV above the probability node is after subtraction of the fixed cost. The two trees are equivalent and either is perfectly acceptable. However, the second tree provides the insight that two of the three outcomes result in a net loss to Acme, even though the weighted average, the EMV, is well in the positive range. (Besides, as you will see in the next section, the second tree is the way the PrecisionTree add-in does it.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the spreadsheet model in Figure 6.4, it is easy to perform a sensitivity analysis. Usually, the main purpose of such an analysis is to see whether the best decision changes as one or more inputs change. As an example, we will see whether the best decision continues to be “proceed with marketing” if the total market decreases. Specifically, we let each of the potential sales volumes decrease by the same percentage and we keep track of the EMV from marketing the product. The results appear in Figure 6.7. For any percentage decrease in cell G3, the EMV from marketing is calculated in cell G4 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=(1-G3)*SUMPRODUCT(D8:D10,B8:B10)-B4</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then a data table is used in the usual way, with cell G3 as the column input cell, to calculate the EMV for various percentage decreases. As you can see, the EMV stays positive, so that marketing remains best, for decreases up to 15%. But if the decrease is 20%, the EMV becomes negative, meaning that the best decision is to abandon the product. In this case, the possible gains from marketing are not large enough to offset the fixed cost.</p>
