            <p class="blog"><strong>AVERAGE WINNINGS FROM A WHEEL OF FORTUNE </strong></p> <p class="blog">Suppose you have the opportunity to play a game with a “wheel of fortune” (similar to the one in a popular television game show). When you spin a large wheel, it is equally likely to stop in any position. Depending on where it stops, you win anywhere from $0 to $1000. Let’s suppose your winnings are actually based on not one spin, but on the average of n spins of the wheel. For example, if n = 2, your winnings are based on the average of two spins. If the first spin results in $580 and the second spin results in $320, you win the average, $450. How does the distribution of your winnings depend on n?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To illustrate the central limit theorem by a simulation of winnings in a game of chance.</p>

First, what does this experiment have to do with random sampling? Here, the population is the set of all outcomes you could obtain from a single spin of the wheel—that is, all dollar values from $0 to $1000. Each spin results in one randomly sampled dollar value from this population. Furthermore, because we have assumed that the wheel is equally likely to land in any position, all possible values in the continuum from $0 to $1000 have the same chance of occurring. The resulting population distribution is called the uniform distribution on the interval from $0 to $1000. (See Figure 7.6, where the 1 on the horizontal axis corresponds to $1000.) It can be shown that the mean and standard deviation of this uniform distribution are <span class="tex-text">\(\mu=\$ 500\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma=\$ 289.^4\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Before we go any further, take a moment to test your own intuition. If you play this game once and your winnings are based on the average of n spins, how likely is that you will win at least $600 if <span class="tex-text">\(n=1 ? \text { if } n=3 ? \text { if } n=10 ?\)</span> (The answers are 0.4, 0.27, and 0.14, respectively, where the last two answers are approximate and are based on the central limit theorem or the simulation. So you are much less likely to win big if your winnings are based on the average of many spins.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now we analyze the distribution of winnings based on the average of n spins. We do so by means of a sequence of simulations in Excel. (See the file Wheel of Fortune Simulation.xlsx, which is set up to work for any number of spins up to 10.) For each simulation, consider 1000 replications of an experiment. Each replication of the experiment simulates n spins of the wheel and calculates the average—that is, the winnings—from these n spins. Based on these 1000 replications, the average and standard deviation of winnings can be calculated, and a histogram of winnings can be formed, for any value of n. These will show clearly how the distribution of winnings depends on n.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The values in Figure 7.7 and the histogram in Figure 7.8 show the results for n = 1. Here there is no averaging—you spin the wheel once and win the amount shown. To replicate this experiment 1000 times and collect statistics, proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Calculating the Distribution of Winnings by Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Random outcomes. To generate outcomes uniformly distributed between $0 and $1000, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B$9&lt;=$B$6,$B$3+($B$4−$B$3)*RAND(), “ ”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B11 and copy it to the entire range B11:K1010. The effect of this formula, given the values in cells B3 and B4, is to generate a random number between 0 and 1 and multiply it by $1000. The effect of the IF part is to fill as many Outcome columns as there are spins in cell B6 and to leave the rest blank.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Winnings. Calculate the winnings in each row in column L as the average of the outcomes of the spins in that row. (Note that the AVERAGE function ignores blanks.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Summary measures. Calculate the average and standard deviation of the 1000 winnings in column L with the AVERAGE and STDEV.S functions. These values appear in cells L4 and L5.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Histogram. Create a histogram of the values in column L.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note the following from Figures 7.7 and 7.8:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The sample mean of the winnings (cell L4) is very close to the population mean, $500.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The standard deviation of the winnings (cell L5) is very close to the population standard deviation, $289.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The histogram is nearly flat.</p>
 <p class="blog">
These properties should come as no surprise. When n = 1, the sample mean is a single observation—that is, no averaging takes place. Therefore, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equivalent to the flat population distribution in Figure 7.6.</p>
 <p class="blog">
But what happens when n &gt; 1? Figure 7.9 shows the results for n = 2. All you need to do is change the number of spins in cell B6, and everything updates automatically. The average winnings are again very close to $500, but the standard deviation of winnings is much lower. In fact, you should find that it is close to <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma / \sqrt{2}=289 / \sqrt{2}=\$ 204\)</span>, exactly as the theory predicts. In addition, the histogram of winnings is no longer flat. It is triangularly shaped—symmetric, but not really bell-shaped.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To develop similar simulations for n = 3, n = 6, n = 10, or any other n, simply change the number of spins in cell B6. The resulting histograms appear in Figures 7.10 through 7.12. They clearly show two effects of increasing n: (1) the histogram becomes more bell-shaped, and (2) there is less variability. However, the mean stays right at $500. This behavior is exactly what the central limit theorem predicts. In fact, because the population distribution is symmetric in this example—it is flat—you can see the effect of the central limit theorem for n much less than 30; it is already evident for n as low as 6.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, it is easy to answer the question we posed previously: How does the probability of winning at least $600 depend on n? For any specific value of n, you can find the fraction of the 1000 replications where the average of n spins is greater than $600 with a COUNTIF formula in cell L6. (The value shown in Figure 7.7, 0.406, is only a point estimate of the true probability, which turns out to be very close to 0.4.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 In general, if a distribution is uniform on the interval from a to b, its mean is the midpoint <span class="tex-text">\((a+b) / 2 \text { and its standard deviation is }(b-a) / \sqrt{12}\)</span>.</p>
