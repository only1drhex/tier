Each hub is used for connecting flights to and from cities within 1000 miles of the hub. Western runs flights among the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. The company wants to determine the smallest number of hubs it will need to cover all of these cities, where a city is “covered” if it is within 1000 miles of at least one hub.

The variables and constraints for this set-covering model appear in Figure 14.57. (See the file Locating Hubs Big Picture. xlsx.) The model is straightforward. There is a binary variable for each city to indicate whether a hub is located there. Then the number of hubs that cover each city is constrained to be at least one. There are no monetary costs in this version of the problem. The goal is to minimize the number of hubs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for Western is shown in Figure 14.58. (See the file Locating Hubs Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the information from Table 14.7 in the input cells. A 1 in a cell indicates that the column city covers the row city, whereas a 0 indicates that the column city does not cover the row city. For example, the three 1’s in row 7 indicate that Boston, New York, and Pittsburgh are the only cities within 1000 miles of Boston.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Binary values for hub locations. Enter any trial values of 0’s or 1’s in the Use_as_hub range to indicate which cities are used as hubs. These are the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Cities covered by hubs. Calculate the total number of hubs within 1000 miles of Atlanta in cell B25 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B6:M6,Use_as_hub)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For any binary values in the decision variable cells range, this formula sums the number of hubs that cover Atlanta. Then copy this to the rest of the Hubs_covered_by range. Note that a value in the Hubs_covered_by range can be 2 or greater. This indicates that a city is within 1000 miles of multiple hubs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Number of hubs. Calculate the total number of hubs used in cell B39 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(Use_as_hub)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The completed Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 14.59. The goal is to minimize the total number of hubs, subject to covering each city by at least one hub and ensuring that the decision variable cells are binary.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 14.60 is a graphical representation of the optimal solution, where the double ovals indicate hub locations and the large circles indicate ranges covered by the hubs. (These large circles are not drawn to scale. In reality, they should be circles of radius 1000 miles centered at the hubs.) Three hubs—in Houston, New York, and Salt Lake City—are needed.<span class="tex-text">\(^{16}\)</span> The Houston hub covers Houston, Atlanta, and New Orleans. The New York hub covers Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Boston, New York, and Chicago. The Salt Lake City hub covers Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Atlanta is the only city covered by two hubs; it can be serviced by New York or Houston.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
An interesting sensitivity analysis for Western’s problem is to see how the solution is affected by the mile limit. Currently, a hub can service all cities within 1000 miles. What if the limit were 800 or 1200 miles, say? To answer this question, you must first collect data on actual distances among all of the cities. Once you have a table of these distances, you can build the binary table, corresponding to the range B6:M17 in Figure 14.58, with IF functions. The modified model appears in the file Locating Hubs with Distances Finished.xlsx (not shown here). You can check that the typical formula in B24 is =IF(B8&lt;=$B$4,1,0), which is then copied to the rest of the B24:M35 range.<span class="tex-text">\(^{17}\)</span> You can then run SolverTable, selecting cell B4 as the single input cell, letting it vary from 800 to 1200 in increments of 100, and designating the hub locations and the number of hubs as outputs. The SolverTable results in Figure 14.61 show the effect of the mile limit. When this limit is lowered to 800 miles, four hubs are required, but when it is increased to 1100 or 1200, only two hubs are required. Note that the solution shown for the 1000-mile limit is different from the previous solution in Figure 14.58, but it still requires three hubs. (This is a case of multiple optimal solutions.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
16 There are multiple optimal solutions for this model, all requiring three hubs, so you might obtain a different solution from ours.</p>
 <p class="blog">
17 We have warned you about using IF functions in Solver models. However, the current use affects only the inputs to the problem, not quantities that depend on the decision variable cells. Therefore, it causes no problems.</p>
