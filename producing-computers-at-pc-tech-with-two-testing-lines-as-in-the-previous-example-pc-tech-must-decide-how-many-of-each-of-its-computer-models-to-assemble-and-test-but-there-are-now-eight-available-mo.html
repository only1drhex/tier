The diagram shown in Figure 13.20 (see the file Product Mix 2 Big Picture.xlsx) is similar to the one for the smaller product mix model, but it is not the same. You must choose the number of computers of each model to produce on each line, the sum of which cannot be larger than the maximum that can be sold. This choice determines the labor hours of each type used and all revenues and costs. No more labor hours can be used than are available.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It might not be immediately obvious what the decision variable cells are for this model (at least not before you look at Figure 13.20). You might think that the company simply needs to decide how many computers of each model to produce. However, because of the two testing lines, this is not enough information. The company must also decide how many of each model to test on each line. For example, suppose they decide to test 100 model 4’s on line 1 and 300 model 4’s on line 2. This means they will need to assemble (and ultimately sell) 400 model 4’s. In other words, given the detailed plan of how many to test on each line, everything else is determined. But without the detailed plan, there is not enough information to complete the model. This is the type of reasoning you must use to determine the appropriate decision variables for any LP model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Algebraic Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We will not spell out the algebraic model for this expanded version of the product mix model because it is so similar to the two-variable product mix model. However, we will say that it is larger, and hence probably more intimidating. Now we need decision variables of the form <span class="tex-text">\(x_{i j}\)</span>, the number of model j computers to test on line i, and the total net profit and each labor availability constraint will include a long SUMPRODUCT formula involving these variables. Instead of focusing on these algebraic expressions, we turn directly to the spreadsheet model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet in Figure 13.21 illustrates the solution procedure for PC Tech’s product mix problem. (See the file Product Mix 2 Finished.xlsx.) The first stage is to develop the spreadsheet model step by step.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the various inputs in the blue ranges. Again, remember that our convention is to color all input cells blue. Enter only numbers, not formulas, in input cells. They should always be numbers directly from the problem statement. (In this case, we supplied them in the spreadsheet template.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Range names. Name the ranges indicated. According to our convention, there are enough named ranges so that the Solver dialog box contains only range names, no cell addresses. Of course, you can name additional ranges if you like. (You can again use the range-naming shortcut explained in the Excel tip for the previous example. That is, you can take advantage of labels in adjacent cells, except for the Profit cell.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Unit margins. Note that two rows of these are required, one for each testing line, because the costs of testing on the two lines are not equal. To calculate them, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B$13-$B$3*B$9-$B4*B10-B$12</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B14 and copy it to the range B14:I15.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Decision variable cells. As discussed above, the decision variable cells are the red cells in rows 19 and 20. You do not have to enter the values shown in Figure 13.21. You can use any trial values initially; Solver will eventually find the optimal values. Note that the four values shown in Figure 13.21 cannot be optimal because they do not satisfy all the constraints. Specifically, this plan uses more labor hours for assembling than are available. However, you do not need to worry about satisfying constraints at this point; Solver will take care of this later.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Labor used. Enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B9:E9,Total_computers_produced)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B26 to calculate the number of assembling hours used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B10:I10,Number_tested_on_line_1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B11:I11,Number_tested_on_line_2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B27 and B28 for the labor hours used on each testing line</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Copying Formulas with Range Names</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you enter a range name in an Excel formula and then copy the formula, the range name reference acts like an absolute reference. Therefore, it wouldn’t work to copy the formula in cell B27 to cell B28. However, this would work if range names hadn’t been used. This is one potential disadvantage of range names that you should be aware of.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Revenues, costs, and profits. The area from row 30 down shows the summary of monetary values. Actually, only the total profit in cell J33 is needed, but it is also useful to calculate the net profit from each computer model on each testing line. To obtain these, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B14*B19</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B31 and copy it to the range B31:I32. Then sum these to obtain the totals in column J. The total in cell J33 is the objective to maximize.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Experimenting with Other Solutions</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Before going any further, you might want to experiment with other values in the decision variable cells. However, it is a real challenge to guess the optimal solution. It is tempting to fill up the decision variable cells corresponding to the largest unit margins. However, this totally ignores their use of the scarce labor hours. If you can guess the optimal solution to this model, you are better than we are!</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver<br /> </strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box should be filled out as shown in Figure 13.22. (Again, note that there are enough named ranges so that only range names appear in this dialog box.) Except that this model has two rows of decision variable cells, the Solver setup is identical to the one in .</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
When you click Solve, you obtain the optimal solution shown in Figure 13.23. The optimal plan is to produce computer models 1, 4, 6, and 7 only, some on testing line 1 and others on testing line 2. This plan uses all the available labor hours for assembling and testing on line 1, but about 1800 of the testing line 2 hours are not used. Also, maximum sales are achieved only for computer models 1, 6, and 7. This is typical of an LP solution. Some of the constraints are met exactly—they are binding—whereas others contain a certain amount of “slack.” The binding constraints prevent PC Tech from earning an even higher profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You typically gain insights into a solution by checking which constraints are binding.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Roundoff Error</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because of the way numbers are stored and calculated on a computer, the optimal values in the decision variable cells and elsewhere can contain small roundoff errors. For example, the value that really appears in cell E20 on one of our PCs is 475.000002015897, not exactly 475. For all practical purposes, this number can be treated as 475, and we have formatted it as such in the spreadsheet. (It appears that roundoff in Solver results are less of a problem in recent versions of Excel.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
If you want to experiment with different inputs to this problem, you can simply change the inputs and then rerun Solver. The second time you use Solver, you do not have to specify the objective and decision variable cells or the constraints. Excel remembers these settings and saves them when you save the file.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can also use SolverTable to perform a more systematic sensitivity analysis on one or more input variables. One possibility appears in Figure 13.24, where the number of available assembling labor hours is allowed to vary from 18,000 to 25,000 in increments of 1000, and the numbers of computers produced and profit are designated as outputs. There are several ways to interpret the output from this sensitivity analysis. First, you can look at columns B through I to see how the product mix changes as more assembling labor hours become available. For assembling labor hours from 18,000 to 23,000, the only thing that changes is that more model 4’s are produced. Beyond 23,000, however, the company starts to produce model 3’s and produces fewer model 7’s. Second, you can see how extra labor hours add to the total profit. Note exactly what this increased profit means. For example, when labor hours increase from 20,000 to 21,000, the model requires that the company must pay $11 apiece for these extra hours (if it uses them). But the net effect is that profit increases by $29,500, or $29.50 per extra hour. In other words, the labor cost increases by $11,000 [=$11(1000)], but this is more than offset by the increase in revenue that comes from having the extra labor hours.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As column J illustrates, it is worthwhile for the company to obtain extra assembling labor hours, even though it has to pay for them, because its profit increases. However, the increase in profit per extra labor hour—the shadow price of assembling labor hours—is not constant. In the top part of the table, it is $29.50 (per extra hour), but it then decreases to $20.44 and then $2.42. The accompanying SolverTable chart of column J illustrates this decreasing shadow price through its decreasing slope.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SolverTable Technical Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Charts and Roundoff</p>
 <p class="blog">
As SolverTable performs its Solver runs, it reports and then charts the values found by Solver. These can include small roundoff errors and slightly misleading charts. For example, the chart in Figure 13.25 shows one possibility, where we varied the cost of testing on line 2 and charted the assembling hours used. Throughout the range, this output value was 20,000, but because of slight roundoff in two of the cells (19999.9999999292 and 20000.0000003259 on our PC), the chart doesn’t appear to be flat. If you see this behavior, you can change the chart manually by modifying its vertical scale.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, you can gain additional insight from Solver’s sensitivity report, shown in Figure 13.26. However, you have to be careful in interpreting this report. Unlike , there are no upper bound (maximum sales) constraints on the decision variable cells. The maximum sales constraints are on the total computers produced (row 21 of the model), not the decision variable cells. Therefore, the only nonzero reduced costs in the top part of the table are for decision variable cells currently at zero (not those at their upper bounds as in the previous example). Each nonzero reduced cost indicates how much the profit margin for this activity would have to change before this activity would be profitable. Also, there is a row in the bottom part of the table for each constraint, including the maximum sales constraints. The interesting values are again the shadow prices. The first two indicate the amount the company would pay for an extra assembling or line 1 testing labor hour. (Does the 29.5 value look familiar? Compare it to the SolverTable results above.) The shadow prices for all binding maximum sales constraints indicate how much more profit the company could make if it could increase its demand by one computer of that model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The information in this sensitivity report is all relevant and definitely provides some insights if studied carefully. However, this really requires you to know the rules Solver uses to create this report. That is, it requires a fairly in-depth knowledge of the theory behind LP sensitivity analysis, more than we have provided here. Fortunately, we believe the same basic information—and more—can be obtained in a more intuitive way by creating appropriate SolverTable reports.</p>
