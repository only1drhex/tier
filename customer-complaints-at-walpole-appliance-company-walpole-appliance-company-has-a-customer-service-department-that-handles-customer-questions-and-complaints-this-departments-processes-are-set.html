            <p class="blog"><strong>CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AT WALPOLE APPLIANCE COMPANY </strong></p> <p class="blog">Walpole Appliance Company has a customer service department that handles customer questions and complaints. This department’s processes are set up to respond quickly and accurately to customers who phone in or email their concerns. However, there is is a sizable minority of customers who prefer to write letters. Traditionally, the customer service department has not been very efficient in responding to these customers.</p> <p class="blog">Letter writers first receive an email asking them to call customer service (which is exactly what letter writers wanted to avoid in the first place), and when they do call, the customer service representative who answers the phone typically has no knowledge of the customer’s problem. As a result, the department manager estimates that 15% of letter writers have not obtained a satisfactory response within 30 days of the time their letters were first received. The manager’s goal is to reduce this value by at least half, that is, to 7.5% or less.</p> <p class="blog">To do so, she changes the process for responding to letter writers. Under the new process, these customers now receive a prompt and courteous form letter that responds to their problem. (This is possible because the vast majority of concerns can be addressed by one of several form letters.) Each form letter states that if the customer still has problems, he or she can call the department. The manager also files the original letters so that if customers do call back, the representative who answers will be able to find their letters quickly and respond intelligently. With this new process in place, the manager has tracked 400 letter writers and has found that only 23 of them are classified as “unsatisfied” after a 30-day period. Does it appear that the manager has achieved her goal?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use a test for a proportion to see whether the new process of responding to complaint letters results in an acceptably low proportion of unsatisfied customers.</p>

The manager’s goal is to reduce the proportion of unsatisfied customers after 30 days from 0.15 to 0.075 or less. Because the burden of proof is on her to “prove” that she has accomplished this goal, we set up the hypotheses as <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0}: p \geq 0.075\)</span> versus <span class="tex-text">\(H_{ a }: p&lt;0.075\)</span>, where p is the proportion of all letter writers who are still unsatisfied after 30 days. The sample proportion she has observed is <span class="tex-text">\(\hat{p}=23 / 400=0.0575\)</span>. This is obviously less than 0.075, but is it enough less to reject the null hypothesis?</p>
 <p class="blog">
The test can be performed with the HT Proportion sheet from the template file, as shown in Figure 9.4. See the file Customer Complaints Finished.xlsx. Note that the standard error and z-value test statistic are calculated according to Equation (9.2), and the p-value is the probability to the left of the test statistic, calculated with the NORM.S.DIST function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(z \text {-value }=\frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{p_{0}\left(1-p_{0}\right) / n}}\)</span> (9.2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The p-value might not be as low as you expected—or as low as the manager would like. In spite of the fact that the sample proportion appears to be well below the target proportion of 0.075, the evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis is not overwhelming. In statistical terminology, the results are significant at the 10% level, but not at the 5% or 1% levels.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The last sheet of the finished file (not shown here) calculates a 95% confidence interval for the unknown proportion p. This confidence interval extends from 0.035 to 0.080. It includes the target value, 0.075, but just barely. In this sense it also provides some support for the argument that the manager has indeed achieved her goal.<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysts might disagree on whether a hypothesis test or a confidence interval is the more appropriate way to present these results. However, we see them as complementary and do not necessarily favor one over the other. The bottom line is that they both provide some, but not totally conclusive, evidence that the manager has achieved her goal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 If you are very observant, you will note that the standard error in cell E7 for the hypothesis test uses the target proportion 0.075. In contrast, the standard error for the confidence interval uses the sample proportion 0.0575. The sampling distribution for a hypothesis test always uses the borderline value between <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0} \text { and } H_{ a }\)</span>. But because confidence intervals are not connected to any hypotheses, their standard errors must rely on sample data. In most cases, however, the two standard errors are practically the same.</p>
