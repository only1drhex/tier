            <p class="blog">Suppose that a survey was carried out in New York, and each respondent was faced<br /> with the following two questions:<br /> a. Is the last digit of your Social Security number odd?<br /> b. Have you ever lied on an employment application?<br /> The second question is, of course, quite sensitive, and for various reasons we might<br /> expect that a number of people would not answer the question honestly, especially if<br /> their response were yes. To overcome this potential bias, respondents were asked to<br /> flip a coin and then to answer question (a) if the result was “head” and answer (b) otherwise.<br /> A yes response was given by 37% of all respondents. What is the probability<br /> that a respondent who was answering the sensitive question, (b), replied yes?</p>

We define the following events:<br /> A: Respondent answers yes.<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(E_{1}\)</span>: Respondent answers question (a).<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(E_{2}\)</span>: Respondent answers question (b).</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the problem discussion we know that P(A) = 0.37. We also know that the<br /> choice of question was determined by a flip of a coin and that p(<span class="tex-text">\(E_{1}\)</span>)=0.50 and<br /> P(<span class="tex-text">\(E_{2}\)</span>)=0.50. In addition, we know the answers to question (a). Since half of all Social<br /> Security numbers have an odd last digit, it must be that the probability of a yes answer,<br /> given that question (a) has been answered, is 0.50—that is, <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(A\setminus E_{1} \right)\)</span> =0.50</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, we require <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(A\setminus E_{2} \right) \)</span> the conditional probability of a yes response, given<br /> that question (b) was answered. We can obtain this probability by using two results<br /> from previous sections. We know that <span class="tex-text">\(E_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(E_{2}\)</span> are mutually exclusive and collectively<br /> exhaustive. We also know that intersections <span class="tex-text">\(E_{1} \cap A \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(E_{2} \cap A \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
are mutually exclusive<br /> and that their union is A. It therefore follows that the sum of the probabilities of these<br /> two intersections is the probability of A, so</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(A\right) =P\left(E_{1}\cap A\right) + P\left(E_{2}\cap A \right)\)</span> <p class="blog">
Next, we use the multiplication rule to obtain</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(E_{1}\cap A\right)=P\left(A\setminus E_{1} \right) P\left(E_{1} \right) =(0.50) \left(0.50\right) =0.25\)</span> <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(E_{2}\cap A\right)=P\left(A\right) &#8211; P\left(E_{1}\cap A \right) =0.37- 0.25=0.12\)</span> <p class="blog">
Then we can solve for the conditional probability:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(A\setminus E_{2} \right) =\frac{P\left(E_{2}\cap A \right) }{P\left(E_{2} \right) } =\frac{0.12}{0.50} =0.24\)</span> <p class="blog">
From this result, we estimate that 24% of the surveyed population has lied on some<br /> employment application.</p>
