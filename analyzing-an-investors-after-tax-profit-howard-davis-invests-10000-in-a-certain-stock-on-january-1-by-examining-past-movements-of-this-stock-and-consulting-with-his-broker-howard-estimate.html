            <p class="blog"><strong>ANALYZING AN INVESTOR’S AFTER-TAX PROFIT</strong></p> <p class="blog">Howard Davis invests $10,000 in a certain stock on January 1. By examining past movements of this stock and consulting with his broker, Howard estimates that the annual return from this stock, X, is normally distributed with mean 5% and standard deviation 14%. Here X (when expressed as a decimal) is the profit Howard receives per dollar invested. It means that on December 31, his $10,000 will have grown to 10,000 (1 + X) dollars. Because Howard is in the 33% tax bracket, he will then have to pay the Internal Revenue Service 33% of his profit, if he makes a profit. However, he doesn’t have to pay any tax if he loses money. Calculate the probability that Howard will have to pay the IRS at least $400, and calculate the probability that he won’t have to pay any tax. Also, calculate the dollar amount such that Howard’s after-tax profit is 90% certain to be less than this amount; that is, calculate the 90th percentile of his after-tax profit.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To determine the after-tax profit Howard Davis can be 90% certain of earning.</p>

Howard’s before-tax profit is 10,000X dollars, so the amount he pays the IRS is 0.33(10,000X)2, or 3300X dollars. We want the probability that this is at least $400. Because 3300X &gt; 400 is the same as X &gt; 4/33, the probability of this outcome can be found as in Figure 5.14. (See the file Tax on Stock Return Finished.xlsx.) It is calculated in cell B8 with the formula spelled out to its right. As you can see, Howard has about a 30% chance of paying at least $400 in taxes.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The probability that he doesn’t have to pay any tax is easier. It is the probability the return on the stock is negative. This is 0.36, found in cell B9 with the formula shown to its right.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To answer the last question, note that the after-tax profit (when X is positive) is 67% of the before-tax profit, or 6700X dollars, and we want its 90th percentile. If this percentile is x, then we know that <span class="tex-text">\(P(6700 X&lt;x)=0.90\)</span>, which is the same as <span class="tex-text">\(P(X&lt;x / 6700)=0.90\)</span>. In words, we want the 90th percentile of the X distribution to be x/6700. From cell B11 of Figure 5.14, the 90th percentile is 22.94%, so the required value of x is $1,537.</p>
