            <p class="blog"><strong>PRODUCING AND SHIPPING TOMATO PRODUCTS AT REDBRAND</strong></p> <p class="blog">RedBrand Company produces a tomato product at three plants. This product can be shipped directly to the company’s twocustomers or it can first be shipped to the company’s two warehouses and then to the customers. Figure 14.21 is a networkrepresentation of RedBrand’s problem. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 represent the plants (these are the origins, denoted by S for supplier),nodes 4 and 5 represent the warehouses (these are the transshipment points, denoted by T), and nodes 6 and 7 represent the customers (these are the destinations, denoted by D). Note that some shipments are allowed among plants, among warehouses, and among customers. Also, some arcs have arrows on both ends. This means that flow is allowed in either direction.</p> <p class="blog">The cost of producing the product is the same at each plant, so RedBrand is concerned with minimizing the total shipping cost incurred in meeting customer demands. The production capacity of each plant (in tons per year) and the demand of each customer are shown in Figure 14.21. For example, plant 1 (node 1) has a capacity of 200, and customer 1 (node 6) has a demand of 400. In addition, the cost (in thousands of dollars) of shipping a ton of the product between each pair of locations is listed in Table 14.3, where a blank indicates that RedBrand cannot ship along that arc. We also assume that at most 200 tons of the product can be shipped along any arc. This is the common arc capacity. RedBrand wants to determine a minimum-cost shipping schedule.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 384pt;" border="0" width="512" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td class="xl63" style="height: 15.0pt; width: 384pt;" colspan="8" width="512" height="20">Table 14.3 Shipping Costs for RedBrand Example (in $1000s)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" height="20">To node</td> <td class="xl63" colspan="7"></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" height="20">From node</td> <td align="right">1</td> <td align="right">2</td> <td align="right">3</td> <td align="right">4</td> <td align="right">5</td> <td align="right">6</td> <td align="right">7</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">1</td> <td align="right">5.0</td> <td align="right">3.0</td> <td align="right">5.0</td> <td align="right">0.5</td> <td align="right">20.0</td> <td align="right">20.0</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">2</td> <td align="right">9.0</td> <td></td> <td align="right">9.0</td> <td align="right">1.0</td> <td align="right">1.0</td> <td align="right">8.0</td> <td align="right">15.0</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">3</td> <td align="right">4.0</td> <td align="right">8.0</td> <td></td> <td align="right">1.0</td> <td align="right">0.5</td> <td align="right">10.0</td> <td align="right">12.0</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">4</td> <td class="xl63" colspan="3" rowspan="4"></td> <td></td> <td align="right">1.2</td> <td align="right">2.0</td> <td align="right">12.0</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">5</td> <td align="right">0.8</td> <td></td> <td align="right">2.0</td> <td align="right">12.0</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">6</td> <td class="xl63" colspan="2" rowspan="2"></td> <td></td> <td align="right">1.0</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="height: 15.0pt;" align="right" height="20">7</td> <td align="right">7.0</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/14.4-2-768x261.png"></div>

The variables and constraints for this logistics model are shown in Figure 14.22. (See the file RedBrand Logistics Big Picture. xlsx.) The key to the model is handling the flow balance constraints. You will see exactly how to implement these when we give step-by-step instructions for developing the spreadsheet model. However, it is not enough, for example, to specify that the flow out of plant 2 is less than or equal to the capacity of plant 2. The reason is that there might also be flow into plant 2 (from another plant). Therefore, the correct flow balance constraint for plant 2 is that its outflow must be less than or equal to its capacity plus its inflow. Equivalently, the net outflow from plant 2 must be less than or equal to its capacity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Other than arc capacity constraints, the only constraints are flow balance constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> To set up the spreadsheet model, proceed as follows. (See Figure 14.23 and the file RedBrand Logistics Finished.xlsx. Also, refer to the network in Figure 14.21.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Origins and destinations. Enter the node numbers (1 to 7) for the origins and destinations of the various arcs in the range A8:B33. Note that the disallowed arcs are not entered in this list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Input data. Enter the unit shipping costs (in thousands of dollars), the common arc capacity, the plant capacities, and the customer demands in the blue cells. Again, only the nonblank entries in Table 14.3 are used to fill the column of unit shipping costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Flows on arcs. Enter any initial values for the flows in the range D8:D33. These are the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Arc capacities. To indicate a common arc capacity for all arcs, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$4</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell F8 and copy it down column F.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Flow balance constraints. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are supply nodes, nodes 4 and 5 are transshipment points, and nodes 6 and 7 are demand nodes. Therefore, set up the left sides of the flow balance constraints appropriately for these three cases. Specifically, enter the net outflow for node 1 in cell I9 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMIF(Destination,H20,Flow)-SUMIF(Origin,H20,Flow)</p>
 <p class="blog">
We generally prefer positive numbers on the right sides of constraints. This is why we calculate net outflows for origins and net inflows for destinations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
and copy it to cell I21. This formula subtracts flows out of node 6 from flows into node 6 to obtain the net inflow for node 6.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Total shipping cost. Calculate the total shipping cost (in thousands of dollars) in cell B36 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(Unit_cost,Flow)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box should be set up as in Figure 14.24. The objective is to minimize total shipping costs, subject to the three types of flow balance constraints and the arc capacity constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution in Figure 14.23 indicates that RedBrand’s customer demand can be satisfied with a shipping cost of $3,260,000. This solution appears graphically in Figure 14.25. Note in particular that plant 1 produces 180 tons (under capacity) and ships it all to plant 3, not directly to warehouses or customers. Also, note that all shipments from the warehouses go directly to customer 1. Then customer 1 ships 180 tons to customer 2. We purposely chose unit shipping costs (probably unrealistic ones) to produce this type of behavior, just to show that it can occur. As you can see, the costs of shipping from plant 1 directly to warehouses or customers are relatively large compared to the cost of shipping directly to plant 3. Similarly, the costs of shipping from plants or warehouses directly to customer 2 are prohibitive. Therefore, RedBrand ships to customer 1 and lets customer 1 forward some of its shipment to customer 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
How much effect does the arc capacity have on the optimal solution? Currently, three of the arcs with positive flow are at the arc capacity of 200. You can use SolverTable to see how sensitive this number and the total cost are to the arc capacity.<span class="tex-text">\(^{6}\)</span> In this case the single input cell for SolverTable is cell B4, which is varied from 150 to 300 in increments of 25. Two quantities are designated as outputs: total cost and the number of arcs at arc capacity. As before, if you want to keep track of an output that does not already exist, you can create it with an appropriate formula in a new cell before running SolverTable. Specifically, you can enter the formula =COUNTIF(Flow,B4) in an unused cell. This formula counts the arcs with flow equal to arc capacity. (See the finished version of the file for a note about this formula.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The SolverTable output in Figure 14.26 is what you would expect. As the arc capacity decreases, more flows bump up against it, and the total cost increases. But even when the arc capacity is increased to 300, two flows are constrained by it. In this sense, even a large arc capacity can cost RedBrand money.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
COUNTIF</p>
 <p class="blog">
The COUNTIF function counts the number of values in a given range that satisfy some criterion. The syntax is =COUNTIF(range, criterion). For example, the formula =COUNTIF(D8:D33,150) counts the number of cells in the range D8:D33 that contain the value 150. This formula could also be entered as =COUNTIF(D8:D33,“=150”). Similarly, the formula =COUNTIF(D8:D33,“&gt;=100”) counts the number of cells in this range with values greater than or equal to 100.<span class="tex-text">\(^{7}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
• There are many variations of this basic logistics model. Two variations are illustrated in the files RedBrand Logistics Multiple Products Finished.xlsx and RedBrand Logistics Shrinkage Finished.xlsx. In the first variation, two products compete for the same arc capacity. In the second, there is shrinkage at the warehouses due to spoilage.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Excel’s Solver uses the simplex method to solve logistics models. However, the simplex method can be simplified dramatically for these types of models. The simplified version of the simplex method, called the network simplex method, is much more efficient than the ordinary simplex method. Specialized computer codes have been written to implement the network simplex method, and all large logistics problems are solved by using the network simplex method. This is fortunate because real logistics models tend to be extremely large. See Winston (2003) for a discussion of this method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• If the given supplies and demands for the nodes are integers and all arc capacities are integers, the logistics model always has an optimal solution with all integer flows. Again, this is very fortunate for large problems—you get integer solutions “for free” without having to use an integer programming algorithm. However, this “integers for free” benefit is guaranteed only for the basic logistics model, as in the original RedBrand model. When the model is modified in certain ways, such as by adding a shrinkage factor, the optimal solution is no longer guaranteed to be integer-valued.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6 Solver’s sensitivity report would not answer our question. This report is useful only for one-at-a-time changes in inputs, and here we are simultaneously changing the upper limit for each flow. However, this report (its bottom section) can be used to assess the effects of changes in plant capacities or customer demands.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7 The COUNTIF and SUMIF functions are limited in that they allow only one condition, such as “&gt;=10”. For this reason, Microsoft added two new functions in Excel 2007, COUNTIFS and SUMIFS, that allow multiple conditions. You can learn about them in online help.</p>
