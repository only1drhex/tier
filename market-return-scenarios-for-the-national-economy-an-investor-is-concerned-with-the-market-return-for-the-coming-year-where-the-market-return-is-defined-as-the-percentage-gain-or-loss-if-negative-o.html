            <p class="blog"><strong>MARKET RETURN SCENARIOS FOR THE NATIONAL ECONOMY</strong></p> <p class="blog">An investor is concerned with the market return for the coming year, where the market return is defined as the percentage gain (or loss, if negative) over the year. The investor believes there are five possible scenarios for the national economy in the coming year: rapid expansion, moderate expansion, no growth, moderate contraction, and serious contraction. Furthermore, she has used all of the information available to her to estimate that the market returns for these scenarios are, respectively, 23%, 18%, 15%, 9%, and 3%. That is, the possible returns vary from a high of 23% to a low of 3%. Also, she has assessed that the probabilities of these outcomes are 0.12, 0.40, 0.25, 0.15, and 0.08. Use this information to describe the probability distribution of the market return.</p> <p class="blog">In reality, there is a continuum of possible returns. The assumption of only five possible returns is clearly an approximation to reality, but such an approximation is often useful.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the probability distribution of the market return for the coming year.</p>

To make the connection between the general notation and this particular example, let X denote the market return for the coming year. Then each possible economic scenario leads to a possible value of X. For example, the first possible value is <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}=23 \%, \text { and its probability is } p\left(x_{1}\right)=0.12\)</span>. These values and probabilities appear in columns B and C of Figure 5.3. (See the file Market Return Finished.xlsx.) Note that the five probabilities sum to 1, as they should. This probability distribution implies, for example, that the probability of a market return at least as large as 18% is <span class="tex-text">\(0.12+0.40=0.52\)</span> because it could occur as a result of rapid or moderate expansion of the economy. Similarly, the probability that the market return is 9% or less is <span class="tex-text">\(0.15+0.08=0.23\)</span> because this could occur as a result of moderate or serious contraction of the economy.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The summary measures of this probability distribution appear in the range B11:B13. They can be calculated with the following steps. (Note that the formulas make use of the range names listed in the figure.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Procedure for Calculating Summary Measur</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Mean return. Calculate the mean return in cell B11 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(Market_return,Probability)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel’s SUMPRODUCT Function</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Excel’s SUMPRODUCT function is a gem, and you should use it whenever possible. It takes (at least) two arguments, which must be ranges of exactly the same size and shape. It sums the products of the values in these ranges. For example, <span class="tex-text">\(=\text { SUMPRODUCT }( A 1: A 3, B 1: B 3)\)</span> is equivalent to the formula <span class="tex-text">\(= A 1^{*} B 1+ A 2 ^{*}B 2+ A 3^{*} B 3\)</span>. If the ranges contain only a few cells, there isn’t much advantage to using SUMPRODUCT, but when the ranges are large, such as A1:A100 and B1:B100, SUMPRODUCT is the only viable option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula illustrates the general rule in Equation (5.6): The mean is the sum of products of possible values and probabilities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\mu=E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_{i} p\left(x_{i}\right)\)</span> (5.6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Squared deviations. To get ready to compute the variance from Equation (5.7), calculate the squared deviations from the mean by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sigma^{2}=\operatorname{Var}(X)=\sum_{i}^{k}\left[x_{i}-E(X)\right]^{2} p\left(x_{i}\right)\)</span> (5.7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=(C4-Mean)^2</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D4 and copying it down through cell D8.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Variance. Calculate the variance of the market return in cell B12 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(Sq_dev_from_mean,Probability)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This illustrates the general formula for variance in Equation (5.7). The variance is always a sum of products of squared deviations from the mean and probabilities. Alternatively, you can skip the calculation of the squared deviations from the mean and use Equation (5.9) directly. This is done in cell C12 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sigma^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_{i}^{2} p\left(x_{i}\right)-\mu^{2}\)</span> (5.9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(Market_return,Market_return,Probability)-Mean^2</p>
 <p class="blog">
As always, range names are not required, but they make the Excel formulas easier to read. You can use them or omit them, as you wish.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By entering the Market_return range twice in this SUMPRODUCT formula, you get the squares. From now on, we will use this simplified formula for variance and dispense with squared deviations from the mean. But regardless of how it is calculated, you should remember the essence of variance: It is a weighted average of squared deviations from the mean.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Standard deviation. Calculate the standard deviation of the market return in cell B13 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SQRT(Variance)</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can see that the mean return is 15.3% and the standard deviation is 5.3%. What do these measures really mean? First, the mean, or expected, return does not imply that the most likely return is 15.3%, nor is this the value that the investor “expects” to occur. In fact, the value 15.3% is not even a possible market return, at least not according to the model. You can understand these measures better in terms of long-run averages. Specifically, if you could imagine the coming year being repeated many times, each time using the probability distribution in columns B and C to generate a market return, then the average of these market returns would be close to 15.3%, and their standard deviation—calculated as in Chapter 2—would be close to 5.3%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before leaving this section, we emphasize a key point, a point that is easy to forget with all the details. The whole point of discussing probability and probability distributions, especially in the context of business problems, is that uncertainty is often a key factor, and you cannot simply ignore it. The mean return in this example is 15.3%. However, it would be far from realistic to treat the actual return as a sure 15.3%, with no uncertainty. If you did this, you would be ignoring the uncertainty completely, and it is often the uncertainty that makes business problems interesting—and adds risk. Therefore, to model such problems in a realistic way, you must deal with probability and probability distributions.</p>
