            <p class="blog"><strong>SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES AT BRIGGS </strong></p> <p class="blog">Briggs, a small business company, requires different numbers of full-time employees on different days of the week. The number of full-time employees required each day is given in Table 14.1. Union rules state that each full-time employee must work five consecutive days and then receive two days off. For example, an employee who works Monday to Friday must be off on Saturday and Sunday. Briggs wants to meet its daily requirements using only full-time employees. Its objective is to minimize the number of full-time employees on its payroll.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="360"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="360">Table 14.1 Employee Requirements</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Day of Week</td> <td>Minimum Number of Employees Required</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Monday</td> <td>17</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tuesday</td> <td>13</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Wednesday</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Thursday</td> <td>19</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Friday</td> <td>14</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Saturday</td> <td>16</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sunday</td> <td>11</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To develop an optimization model that relates five-day shift schedules to daily numbers of employees available, and to use Solver to find a schedule that uses the fewest number of employees and meets all daily workforce requirements.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The only inputs needed for this problem are the minimum employee requirements in Table 14.1, but these are not easy to obtain. They would probably be obtained through a combination of two quantitative techniques: forecasting (Chapter 12) and queueing analysis (not covered in this book). The company would first use historical data to forecast customer arrival patterns throughout a typical week. It would then use queueing analysis to translate these arrival patterns into employee requirements on a daily basis. Actually, we have kept the problem relatively simple by considering only daily requirements. In a realistic setting, the organization might forecast employee requirements on an hourly or even a 15-minute basis.</p>

A diagram of this model appears in Figure 14.1. (See the file Employee Scheduling Big Picture.xlsx.) The trickiest part is identifying the appropriate decision variables. You might think that the decision variables are the numbers of employees working on the various days of the week. Clearly, these values must eventually be determined. However, it is not enough to specify, for example, that 18 employees are working on Monday. The problem is that this doesn’t indicate when these 18 employees start their five-day shifts. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to implement the five-consecutive-day, two-day-off requirement. (If you don’t believe this, try developing your own model with the wrong decision variables. You will eventually reach a dead end.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In real employee-scheduling problems, much of the work involves forecasting and queueing analysis to obtain employee requirements. This must be done before an optimal schedule can be found.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The trick is to define the decision variables as the numbers of employees working each of the seven possible five-day shifts. By knowing these values, the other output variables can be calculated. For example, the number working on Thursday is the sum of those who begin their five-day shifts on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The key to this model is choosing the correct decision variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Choosing the Decision Variables</p>
 <p class="blog">
The decision variables should always be chosen so that their values determine all required outputs in the model. In other words, their values should tell the company exactly how to run its business. Sometimes the choice of decision variables is obvious, but in many cases (as in this employee scheduling model), the proper choice of decision variables takes some deeper thinking about the problem. An improper choice of decision variables typically leads to a dead end, where their values do not supply enough information to calculate required outputs or implement certain constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that this is a “wraparound” problem. We assume that the daily requirements in Table 14.1 and the employee schedules continue week after week. So, for example, the employees assigned to the Thursday through Monday shift always wrap around from one week to the next on their five-day shift.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for this problem is shown in Figure 14.2. (See the file Employee Scheduling Finished. xlsx.) To develop this model, proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Developing the Employee Scheduling Model</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs and range names. Enter the number of employees needed on each day of the week (from Table 14.1) in the blue cells, and create the range names shown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Employees beginning each day. Enter any trial values for the number of employees beginning work on each day of the week in the Employees_starting range. These beginning days determine the possible five-day shifts. For example, the employees in cell B4 work Monday through Friday.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Employees on hand each day. The key to this solution is to realize that the numbers in the Employees_starting range—the decision variable cells—do not represent the number of employees who will show up each day. As an example, the number in cell B4 represent those who start on Monday work Monday through Friday. Therefore, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$4</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B14 and copy it across to cell F14. Proceed similarly for rows 15–20, being careful to take “wraparounds” into account. For example, the workers starting on Thursday work Thursday through Sunday, plus Monday. Then calculate the total number who are available on each day by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(B14:B20)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B23 and copying it across row 23.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Ctrl + Enter Shortcut</p>
 <p class="blog">
You often enter a typical formula in a cell and then copy it. One way to do this efficiently is to select the entire range, here B23:H23. Then enter the typical formula, here =SUM(B14:B20), and press Ctrl+Enter. This has the same effect as copying, but it is slightly quicker.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Total employees. Calculate the total number of employees in cell B28 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(Employees_starting)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that there is no double-counting in this sum. For example, the employees in cells B4 and B5 are not the same people.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At this point, you might want to experiment with the numbers in the decision variable cell range to see whether you can guess an optimal solution (without looking at Figure 14.2). It is not that easy. Each employee who starts on a given day works the next four days as well, so when you find a solution that meets the minimal requirements for the various days, you usually have a few more employees available on some days than are needed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Invoke Solver and fill out its main dialog box as shown in Figure 14.3. (You don’t need to include the integer constraint yet. This will be discussed shortly.) Make sure you check the Non-Negative option and select the Simplex LP method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The optimal solution shown in Figure 14.2 has one drawback: It requires the number of employees starting work on some days to be a fraction. Because part-time employees are not allowed (an assumption of the model), this solution is unrealistic. However, it is simple to add an integer constraint on the decision variable cells. This integer constraint appears in Figure 14.3. (To create this integer constraint in Solver’s Add Constraint dialog box, select the Employees_starting for the left side, and select “int” in the middle dropdown list. The word “integer” will automatically appear in the right side of the constraint.) With this integer constraint, the optimal solution appears in Figure 14.4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Technical Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Solver Integer Optimality Setting</p>
 <p class="blog">
When working with integer constraints, you should be aware of Solver’s<br /> Integer Optimality setting. The idea is as follows. As Solver searches for the best integer solution, it is often able to find a “good” integer solution fairly quickly, but it often has to spend a lot of time finding slightly better solutions. A nonzero setting allows it to quit early. The default setting is 1 (percent). (It used to be 5, which you still might see, depending on your version of Excel.) This means that if Solver finds a feasible integer solution that is guaranteed to have an objective value no more than 1% from the optimal value, it will quit and report this good solution (which might even be the optimal solution). Therefore, if you keep this default setting, your integer solutions will sometimes not be optimal, but they will be close. If you want to ensure that you get an optimal solution, you can change the Solver setting to zero. (Click the Options button, and then under the All Methods tab, uncheck Ignore Integer Constraints and enter a value in the Integer Optimality (%) box.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Set Solver’s Integer Optimality to zero to ensure that you get the optimal integer solution. Be aware, however, that this can incur significant extra computing time for larger models.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The decision variable cells in the optimal solution indicate the numbers of workers who start their five-day shifts on the various days. You can then look at the columns of the B14:H20 range to see which employees are working on any given day. This optimal solution is typical in scheduling problems. Due to a labor constraint—each employee must work five consecutive days and then have two days off—it is typically impossible to meet the minimum employee requirements exactly. To ensure that there are enough employees available on busy days, it is necessary to have more than enough on hand on light days.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Multiple optimal solutions have different values in the decision variable cells, but they all have the same objective value.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another interesting aspect of this problem is that when you solve it, you might get a different schedule that is still optimal— that is, a solution that still uses a total of 23 employees and meets all constraints. This is a case of multiple optimal solutions, not at all uncommon in linear optimization problems. In fact, it is typically good news for a manager, who can then choose among the optimal solutions using other, possibly nonquantitative criteria.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The most obvious type of sensitivity analysis in this example is to analyze the effect of employee requirements on the optimal solution. Specifically, let’s suppose the number of employees needed on each day of the week increases by two, four, or six. How does this change the total number of employees needed? You can answer this with SolverTable, but you must first modify the model slightly, as shown in Figure 14.5. The problem is that we want to increase each of the daily minimal required values by the same amount. The trick is to enter the original requirements in row 12, enter a trial value for the extra number required per day in cell K12, enter the formula =B12+$K$12 in cell B27, and then copy this formula across to cell H27. Then you can use the one-way SolverTable option, using the Extra cell as the single input, letting it vary from 0 to 6 in increments of 2, and specifying the Total_employees cell as the single output cell.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To run some sensitivity analyses with SolverTable, you need to modify the original model slightly to incorporate the effect of the input being varied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results appear in Figure 14.6. When the requirement increases by two each day, only two extra employees are necessary (scheduled appropriately). However, when the requirement increases by four each day, more than four extra employees are necessary. The same is true when the requirement increases by six each day. This might surprise you at first, but there is an intuitive reason: Each extra worker works only five days of the week.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We did not use Solver’s sensitivity report here for two reasons. First, Solver does not offer a sensitivity report for models with integer constraints. Second, even if the integer constraints are deleted, Solver’s sensitivity report does not answer questions about multiple input changes, as we have asked here. It is used for questions about one-at-a-time changes to inputs, such as a change to Thursday’s worker requirement. In this sense, SolverTable is a more flexible tool.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
• The employee scheduling example is called a static scheduling model because we assume that the company faces the same situation each week. In reality, demands change over time, employees take vacations in the summer, and so on, so the company does not face the same situation each week. A dynamic scheduling model (not covered here) is necessary for such problems.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• In a weekly scheduling model for a supermarket or a fast-food restaurant, the number of decision variables can grow quickly and optimization software such as Solver will have difficulty finding an optimal solution. In such cases, heuristic methods (essentially clever trial-and-error algorithms) have been used to find good solutions to the problem. For example, Love and Hoey (1990) indicate how this was done for a particular staff scheduling problem.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Heuristic solutions are often close to optimal, but they are never guaranteed to be optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Our model can easily be expanded to handle part-time employees, the use of overtime, and alternative objectives such as maximizing the number of weekend days off received by employees. You are asked to explore such extensions in the problems.</p>
