            <p class="blog"><strong>NEW PRODUCT DECISIONS AT ACME WITH TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY </strong></p> <p class="blog">In this version of the example, we assume as before that the new product is still in the development stage. However, we now assume that there is a chance that the product will be a failure for technological reasons, such as a new drug that fails to meet FDA approval. At this point in the development process, Acme assesses the probability of technological failure to be 0.2. The $6 million fixed cost from before is now broken down into two components: $4 million for addition development costs and $2 million for fixed costs of marketing, the latter to be incurred only if the product is a technological success and the company decides to market it. The unit margin and the probability distribution of the product’s sales volume if it is marketed are the same as before. How should Acme proceed?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use a decision tree to find Acme’s EMV-maximizing strategy for this two-stage decision problem.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The probability of technological failure might be based partly on historical data—the technological failure rate of similar products in the past—but it is probably partly subjective, based on how the product’s development has proceeded so far. The probability distribution of sales volume is a more difficult issue. When Acme makes its first decision, right now, it must look ahead to see how the market might look in the future, after the development stage, which could be quite a while from now. (The same issue is relevant in , although we didn’t discuss it there.) This a difficult assessment, and it is an obvious candidate for an eventual sensitivity analysis.<span class="tex-text">\(^{6}\)</span></p> <p class="blog">6 We have purposely avoided the use of Bayes’ rule for now. It will be used in the next version of the Acme problem.</p>

The reason this is a two-stage decision problem is that Acme can decide right away to stop development and abandon the product, thus saving further fixed costs of development. However, if Acme decides to continue development and the product turns out to be a technological success, a second decision on whether to market the product must still be made.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A spreadsheet model such as in Figure 6.1 for the single-stage problem could be developed to calculate the relevant EMVs, but this isn’t as easy as it sounds. A much better way is to use a decision tree, using the PrecisionTree add-in. The finished tree appears in Figure 6.12. (See the file New Product Decisions &#8211; Technological Uncertainty Finished.xlsx.) The first decision is whether to continue development. If “Yes,” the fixed development cost is incurred, so it is entered on this branch. Then there is a probability node for the technological success or failure. If it’s a failure, there are no further costs, but the fixed development cost is lost. If it’s a success, Acme must decide whether to market the product. From this point, the tree is exactly like the single-stage tree, except that the fixed development cost has been incurred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By following the TRUE branches, you can see Acme’s best strategy. The company should continue development, and if the product is a technological success, it should be marketed. The EMV, again the weighted average of all possible monetary outcomes with this strategy, is $59,200. However, this is only the expected value, or mean, of the probability distribution of monetary outcomes. You can see the full probability distribution by requesting a risk profile from PrecisionTree (through the Decision Analysis dropdown). This appears, both in graphical and tabular form, in Figure 6.13. Note that Acme has a 64% chance of incurring a net loss with this strategy, including a possible loss of $4.38 million. This doesn’t sound good. However, the company has a 36% chance of a net gain of $4.8 million and, in an expected value sense, this more than offsets the possible losses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>PrecisionTree Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Placement of Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
When you request a risk profile or other PrecisionTree reports, they are placed in a new workbook by default. If you would rather have them placed in the same workbook as your decision tree, select Application Settings from the Utilities dropdown list on the PrecisionTree ribbon, and change the “Place Reports In” setting to Active Workbook. You only have to do this once.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We won’t perform any systematic sensitivity analyses on this model (we ask you to do some in the problems), but it is easy to show that the best strategy is quite sensitive to the probability of technological success. If you change this probability from 0.8 to 0.75 in cell B4, the tree automatically recalculates, with the results in Figure 6.14. With just this small change, the best decision changes completely. Now the company should discontinue development and abandon the product. There is evidently not a large enough chance of recovering the fixed development cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We return to the probability distribution of eventual sales volume. The interpretation here is that at the time of the first decision, Acme has assessed what the market might look like after the development stage, which could be quite a while from now. Again, this is a difficult assessment. Acme could instead break this assessment into parts. It could first assess a probability distribution for how the general market for such products might change—up, down, or no change, for example—by the time development is completed. Then for each of these general markets, it could assess a probability distribution for the sales volume of its new product. By breaking it up in this way, Acme might be able to make a more accurate assessment, but the decision tree would be somewhat more complex. We ask you to explore this in one of the problems.</p>
