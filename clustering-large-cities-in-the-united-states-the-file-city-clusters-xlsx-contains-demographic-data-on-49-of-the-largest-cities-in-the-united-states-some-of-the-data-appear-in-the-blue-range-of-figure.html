            <p class="blog"><strong>CLUSTERING LARGE CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES</strong></p> <p class="blog">The file City Clusters.xlsx contains demographic data on 49 of the largest cities in the United States.Some of the data appear in the blue range of Figure 17.23. For example,Atlanta is 67% African American, 2% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. It has a median ageof 31, a 5% unemployment rate, and a per-capita income of $22,000. The goal in this example is to group these 49 cities into four clusters of cities that are demographically similar. (You could then experiment with the number of clusters. For this discussion, the number is fixed at four.) The basic idea is to choose a city to anchor, or center, each cluster. Each city is then assigned to the nearest cluster center, where nearest is defined in terms of the six demographic variables. The objective is to minimize the sum of the distances from the 49 cities to their four cluster centers.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use Evolutionary Solver to find four cities to be used as cluster centers and to assign all other cities to one of these cluster centers.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The basic demographic data on cities are widely available.

This example uses a variation of the usual K-means procedure (with K = 4) because its cluster centers are chosen from the existing 49 cities. In a typical K-means clustering, the cluster centers are not necessarily equal to any of the existing members, but the ideas are very similar. ( illustrates the more typical procedure.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Regarding the data, if you use raw units, the percentages of African American and Hispanic will drive everything because these values are more spread out than the other demographic attributes. You can see this by calculating means and standard deviations of the characteristics. (See Figure 17.24, which also includes correlations between the attributes.) To remedy this problem, each demographic attribute is typically standardized by subtracting the attribute’s mean and dividing the difference by the attribute’s standard deviation. For example, the average city has 24.35% African Americans with a standard deviation of 18.11%. On a standardized basis, Atlanta is larger by (67 – 24.35)/18.11 = 2.355 standard deviations on the African- American attribute than a typical city. Working with standardized values for each attribute ensures that the analysis is unit-free. To create the standardized values shown in Figure 17.24, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=(C15-AVERAGE(C$15:C$63))/STDEV(C$15:C$63)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell I15 and copy it across to column N and down to row 63.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Now that all of the attributes have been standardized, you can develop the spreadsheet model as follows. It is shown in two parts in Figures 17.25 and 17.26.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Lookup table. One key to the model is to have an index (1 to 49) for the cities so that you can refer to them by index and then look up their characteristics with a VLOOKUP function. Therefore, name the range A15:N63 as LookupTable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Decision variables. The only decision variable cells appear in the City_index range of Figure 17.25. They are the indexes of the four cities chosen as cluster centers. Enter any four integers from 1 to 49 in these cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Corresponding cities and standardized attributes. You can find the names and standardized attributes of the cluster centers with VLOOKUP functions. First, enter the function</p>
 <p class="blog">
=VLOOKUP(B6,LookupTable,2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell A6 and copy it to the range A6:A9. Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=VLOOKUP($B6,LookupTable,C$4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in C6 and copy it to the range C6:H9. Note, for example, that the standardized PctAfrAmer is the ninth column of the lookup table. This explains the column offset entries in row 4 of Figure 17.25.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Distances to centers. The next step is to see how far each city is from each of the cluster centers. Let zi be standardized attribute i for a typical city, and let ci be standardized attribute i for a typical cluster center. One way (but not the only way) to measure the distance from this city to this cluster center with the usual Euclidean distance formula</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \text { Distance }=\sqrt{\sum_{i}\left(z_{i}-c_{i}\right)^{2}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
where the sum is over all six attributes. These distances appear in columns P through S of Figure 17.26. For example, the value in cell P15 is the distance from Albuquerque to the first cluster center (San Francisco), the value in Q15 is the distance from Albuquerque to the second cluster center (Philadelphia), and so on. These calculations can be performed in several equivalent ways. Probably the quickest way is to enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SQRT(SUMXMY2($I15:$N15,$C$6:$H$6))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell P15 and copy it to the range P15:S63. (The function SUMXMY2 calculates the differences between the elements of the two range arguments and then sums the squares of these differences—exactly what is required.) The copied versions in columns Q, R, and S then have to be modified slightly. Each 6 in the second range argument needs to be changed to 7 in column Q, to 8 in column R, and to 9 in column S.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Assignments to cluster centers. Each city is assigned to the cluster center that has the smallest distance. Therefore, find the minimum distances in column T by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MIN(P15:S15)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell T15 and copying it down. Then you can identify the cluster index (1 through 4) and city name of the cluster center that yields the minimum with the MATCH function. Specifically, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MATCH(T15,P15:S15,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell U15 and copy it down. For example, the 2.109 minimum distance for Albuquerque corresponds to the third distance, so Albuquerque is assigned to the third cluster center. Finally, to get the name of the third cluster center, you can use the INDEX function. Enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=INDEX(Cluster_center,U15,l)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell V15 and copy it down. This formula returns the name in the second row and first (only) column of the Cluster_ center range (in Figure 17.25).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
INDEX</p>
 <p class="blog">
The function INDEX, using the syntax INDEX(Range,Row,Column), is usually used to return the value in a given row and column of a specified range. For example, INDEX(A5:C10,3,2) returns the value in the third row and second column of the range A5:C10, that is, the value in cell B7. If the given range is a single row, the row argument can be omitted. If the given range is a single column, the column argument can be omitted.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Sum of distances. The objective is to minimize the sum of distances from all cities to the cluster centers to which they are assigned. Calculate this objective in cell B11 (in Figure 14.25) with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(T15:T63)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Solver dialog box should be set up as shown in Figure 17.27. Because the decision variable cells represent indexes of cluster centers, they must be integer-constrained, and suitable lower and upper limits are 1 and 49 (the number of cities). This problem is considerably more difficult to solve, so you should use Evolutionary Solver and allow plenty of time to search through a lot of potential solutions. (Actually, it finds the optimal solution very quickly, but then it runs a long time to verify that this solution is optimal.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The solution in Figure 17.28, which uses Los Angeles, Memphis, Omaha, and San Francisco, is the best we found. You might find a slightly different solution, depending on your Solver settings and how long you let Solver run, but you should obtain a similar value in the objective cell. If you look closely at the cities assigned to each cluster center, this solution begins to make intuitive sense. The San Francisco cluster consists of rich, older, highly Asian cities. The Memphis cluster consists of highly African-American cities with high unemployment rates. The Omaha cluster consists of average income cities with few minorities. The Los Angeles cluster consists of highly Hispanic cities with high unemployment rates.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In cluster analysis, the number of clusters is typically unknown ahead of time. Some experimentation with the number of clusters is usually required.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Why four clusters? You could easily try three clusters or five clusters. However, when the number of clusters increases, the sum of distances will certainly decrease. In fact, you could obtain an objective value of 0 by using 49 clusters, one for each city, but this wouldn’t provide any useful information. Therefore, to choose the “best” number of clusters, the typical approach is to stop adding clusters when the sum of distances fails to decrease by a substantial amount.</p>
