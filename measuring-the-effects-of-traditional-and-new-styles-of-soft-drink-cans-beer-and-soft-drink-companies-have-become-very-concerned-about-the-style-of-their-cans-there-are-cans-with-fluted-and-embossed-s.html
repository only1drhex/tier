            <p class="blog"><strong>MEASURING THE EFFECTS OF TRADITIONAL AND NEW STYLES OF SOFT-DRINK CANS</strong></p> <p class="blog">Beer and soft-drink companies have become very concerned about the style of their cans. There are cans with fluted and embossed sides and cans with six-color graphics and holograms. Coca-Cola even introduced a contoured can,shaped like the old-fashioned Coke bottle minus the neck. Evidently, these companies believe the style of the can makes a difference to consumers, which presumably translates into higher sales.</p> <p class="blog">Assume that a soft-drink company is considering a style change to its current can, which has been the company’s trademark for many years. To determine whether this new style is popular with consumers, the company runs a number of focus group sessions around the country. At each of these sessions, randomly selected consumers are allowed to examine the new and traditional styles, exchange ideas, and offer their opinions. Eventually, they fill out a form where, among other questions, they are asked to respond to the following items, each on a scale of 1 to 7, 7 being the best:</p> <p class="blog">• Rate the attractiveness of the traditional-style can (AO).<br /> • Rate the attractiveness of the new-style can (AN).<br /> • Rate the likelihood that you would buy the product with the traditional-style can (WBO).<br /> • Rate the likelihood that you would buy the product with the new-style can (WBN).</p> <p class="blog">(A and WB stand for “attractiveness” and “would buy,” and O and N stand for “old” and “new.”) The data are listed in the file Soft-Drink Cans.xlsx. What can the company conclude from these data? Are hypothesis tests appropriate?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong><br /> To use paired-sample t tests for differences between means to see whether consumers rate the attractiveness, and their likelihood to purchase, higher for a new-style can than for the traditional-style can.</p>

First, it is a good idea to examine summary statistics for the data. The averages from each survey item are shown at the bottom of Figure 9.5. They indicate some support for the new-style can. Also, you might expect the ratings for a given consumer to be correlated. This turns out to be the case, as shown by the relatively large positive correlations in Figure 9.5. These large positive correlations indicate that if you want to examine differences between survey items, a paired-sample procedure will make the most efficient use of the data. Of course, a paired-sample procedure also makes sense because each consumer answers each<br /> item on the form. If this is confusing, think about the following alternative setup, where there are four separate groups of consumers. The first group responds to item 1 only, the second group responds to item 2 only, and so on. Then the responses to the various items are in no way paired, and an independent-sample procedure would be used instead. However, this experimental design is not as efficient as the paired design in terms of making the best use of a given amount of data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are several differences of interest. The two most obvious are the difference between the attractiveness ratings of the two styles and the difference between the likelihoods of buying the two styles—that is, column B minus column C and column D minus column E. A third difference of interest is the difference between the attractiveness ratings of the new style and the likelihoods of buying the new can—that is, column C minus column E. This difference indicates whether perceptions of the new-style can are likely to translate into actual sales. Finally, a fourth difference that might be of interest is the difference between the third difference (column C minus column E) and the similar difference for the old style (column B minus column D). This checks whether the translation of perceptions into sales is any different for the two styles of cans.</p>
 <p class="blog">
All of these differences appear next to the original data in Figure 9.6.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For each of the differences, you can test the mean difference over all potential consumers with a paired-sample analysis. (You actually run the one-sample procedure on the difference variables.) Exactly as in the previous chapter, each difference variable is treated as a single sample and the same t test as in Section 9-3 is run on this sample. In each case the hypothesized difference, <span class="tex-text">\(D_{0}\)</span>, is 0. The only question is whether to run one-tailed or two-tailed tests. This depends on the prior beliefs of the company. We have run them all as two-tailed tests. In any case, you can change two-tailed p-values to one-tailed p-values by dividing by 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results for all five differences appear in Figure 9.7. The calculations were made with the HT Paired Mean Diff sheet from the template file and were then rearranged to all be on the same sheet. Here are some comments on the results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• From the output for AO &#8211; AN, there is overwhelming evidence that consumers, on average, rate the attractiveness of the new design higher than the attractiveness of the current design. The t-distributed test statistic is -5.351, calculated as</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{-0.539-0}{0.101}=-5.351\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The corresponding p-value for a two-tailed test of the mean difference is (to four decimal places) 0.0000. A 99% confidence interval (not shown) for the mean difference extends from 20.801 to 20.277. Note that this 99% confidence interval does not include the hypothesized value 0. This is consistent with the fact that the two-tailed p-value is less than 0.01. (Recall the relationship between confidence intervals and two-tailed hypothesis tests from Section 9-2g.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The results are basically the same for the difference between consumers’ likelihoods of buying the product with the two<br /> styles, WBO &#8211; WBN. Again, consumers are definitely more likely, on average, to buy the product with the new-style can.<br /> A 99% confidence interval for the mean difference (not shown) extends from -0.739 to -0.216, which is again all negative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The company’s hypothesis that consumers’ ratings of attractiveness of the new-style can are greater, on average, than their likelihoods of buying the product with this style can is confirmed. In this case, the relevant difference is AN &#8211; WBN. Although the results are shown for a two-tailed test, the results for a one-tailed “greater than” test are easy to infer. You simply divide the p-value in cell D11 by 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• There is no evidence that the difference between attractiveness ratings and the likelihood of buying is any different for the new-style can than for the current-style can. Here the relevant difference is 1AN &#8211; WBN2 &#8211; 1AO &#8211; WBO2. The test statistic for a two-tailed test of this difference is 0.401 and the corresponding p-value, 0.689, isn’t even close to any of this traditional significance levels. Furthermore, a 99% confidence interval for this mean difference (not shown) extends from a negative value, 20.336, to a positive value, 0.458.</p>
 <p class="blog">
These results are further supported by histograms of the difference variables, such as those shown in Figures 9.8 and 9.9. (Box plots could be used instead.) The histogram in Figure 9.8 shows many more negative differences than positive differences. This leads to the large negative test statistic and the all-negative confidence interval. In contrast, the histogram in Figure 9.9 is almost perfectly symmetric around 0 and hence provides no evidence that this mean difference is not zero.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This example illustrates once again how hypothesis tests and confidence intervals provide complementary information, although the confidence intervals are arguably more useful here. The hypothesis test for the first difference, for example, shows that the average rating for the new style is undoubtedly larger than for the current style. This is useful information, but it is even more useful to know how much larger the average for the new style is. A confidence interval provides this information. We conclude this example by recalling the distinction between practical significance and statistical significance. Due to the extremely low p-values, the results in columns B to E of Figure 9.7, leave no doubt as to statistical significance. But this could be due to the large sample size. That is, if the true mean differences are even slightly different from 0, large samples will almost surely discover this and report small p-values. The soft-drink company, on the other hand, is more interested in knowing whether the observed differences are of any practical importance. This is not a statistical question. It is a question of what differences are important for the business. We suspect that the company would indeed be quite impressed with the observed differences in the sample—and might very well switch to the new-style can.</p>
