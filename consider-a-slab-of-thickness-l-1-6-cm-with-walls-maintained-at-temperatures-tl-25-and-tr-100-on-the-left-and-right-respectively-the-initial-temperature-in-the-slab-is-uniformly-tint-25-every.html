 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T (x ,0) = T_{L} x ∈ (0,L )\)</span> (9.41)</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. If there are just three points in the domain, there is just one unknown temperature, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{mid}\)</span>. Let us say the three temperatures are <span class="tex-text">\(T_{1} = T_{L}, T_{2} = T_{mid}\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\( T_{3} = T_{R}\)</span>. Note that we have to discretize in time too. This is very much like the two-dimensional grid we had used purely in space earlier. The only difference is that since the direction y is a spatial direction, the customary space-time notation is to use the index n as a superscript for stepping in time and i for stepping in space. That is, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n}\)</span> denotes <span class="tex-text">\(T( x_{i} , t^{n}\)</span> , where the superscript n denotes the index in time.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Fig. 9.5 shows a typical space-time stencil for unsteady problems. We can now dis-cretize each of the derivatives in the governing equation as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial x^{2}} ≈ \frac{T_{i+1}^{n} &#8211; 2T_{i}^{n} + T_{i-1}^{n} }{(Δx)^{2}}\)</span> (9.42)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{T_{i}^{n+1} &#8211; T_{i}^{n}}{Δt}\)</span> (9.43)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The order of accuracy of the two derivatives are O (∆x² ) and O(∆t ) respectively. The overall scheme is therefore given by</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{T_{i}^{n+1} &#8211; T_{i}^{n}}{Δt} = \alpha \frac{T_{i+1}^{n} &#8211; 2T_{i}^{n} + T_{i-1}^{n} }{(Δx)^{2}}\)</span> (9.44)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and is O ( ∆x² , ∆t) in accuracy.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comment: You might ask, “Why did we choose the forward difference operator for the time derivative? Why not the central or the backward difference?” This would be an astute question. The current choice that we have made is called FTCS (for-ward time central space). The other two would also be legitimate choices and lead to CTCS (center time center space) and BTCS (backward time center space) methods. It turns out CTCS, for various reasons, is not a good choice despite seemingly being O ( ∆x² , ∆t²) . We will, however, examine BTCS shortly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Some alternate discretizations are as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{T_{i}^{n} &#8211; T_{i}^{n-1}}{Δt} = \alpha \frac{T_{i+1}^{n} &#8211; 2T_{i}^{n} + T_{i-1}^{n} }{(Δx)^{2}}\)</span> (9.45)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This, of course, is the BTCS discussed just previosly and is also O( ∆x² , ∆t) . There exists an alternate discretization with a nonobvious trick that enables O( ∆x² , ∆t²) without resorting to CTCS. This is called the Crank-Nicolson scheme and is somewhat like an average of the FTCS and BTCS. The scheme is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{T_{i}^{n} &#8211; T_{i}^{n-1}}{Δt} = \frac{\alpha}{2} \left\lgroup \frac{T_{i+1}^{n} &#8211; 2T_{i}^{n} + T_{i-1}^{n} }{Δx^{2}} + \frac{T_{i+1}^{n-1} &#8211; 2T_{i}^{n-1} + T_{i-1}^{n-1} }{Δx^{2}}\right\rgroup \)</span> (9.46)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comment: We will not prove the O( ∆x² , ∆t²) accuracy of Crank-Nicolson here. You can try it as an advanced exercise yourself by writing out a Taylor series expansion of both sides in two variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. For finding out how the temperature at any node will evolve in time, we need to find out how values at the future time step <span class="tex-text">\((t^{n+1})\)</span> depend on the values at the current time step <span class="tex-text">\((t^{n})\)</span>. So, we will rearrange terms so that terms containing different time levels appear on different sides. We will consider two discretizations here—FTCS and BTCS.<br /> For FTCS, rearranging Eq. (9.44), we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1} = T_{i}^{n} + \frac{\alpha ∆t}{∆x^{2}} (T_{i+1}^{n} &#8211; 2T_{i}^{n} + T_{i-1}^{n})\)</span> (9.47)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Notice the appearance of the term <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\alpha ∆t}{∆x^{2}}\)</span> . This is a nondimensional term. It is called the diffusion number, and we will label it with D from now on. It should remind you of the Fourier number <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\alpha t}{L^{2}}\)</span> . In terms of D, the equation is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1} = (1 &#8211; 2D) T_{i}^{n} + D (T_{i+1}^{n} + T_{i-1}^{n}) \)</span> (9.48)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comment: Notice how naturally the diffusion number appears out of the discreti-zation. If ∆x = L, we would, in fact, directly obtain the Fourier number. It is re-markable how many times numerical discretizations throw up physical parameters naturally.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider BTCS now. For convenience, we will replace the (future, present) time levels (n–1,n) in Eq. (9.45) with (n,n + 1). Rearranging Eq. (9.45) and substituting</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( D = \frac{\alpha ∆t}{∆x^{2}}\)</span>, we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( -D (T_{i+1}^{n+1} + T_{i-1}^{n+1}) + (1 + 2D)T_{i}^{n+1} = T_{i}^{n} \)</span> (9.49)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comment: Notice that, unlike FTCS, where it was possible to calculate <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1}\)</span> for each i independent of the values at other nodes, in BTCS we obtain <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1}\)</span> as a part of a system of equations that have to be solved simultaneously for all nodes. Similarly, Crank-Nicolson also requires solution of a system of equations. Since the expres-sion for the updated temperature is available explictly for each node in FTCS, it is commonly called the explicit scheme, whereas BTCS and Crank-Nicolson are called implicit schemes. Clearly, implicit schemes require more computational effort. Is there any reason to use them then? We will see shortly that it does make sense to use them in several situations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Consider just three points in the domain. Two of them are known and fixed due to Dirichlet boundary conditions. So, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{1}^{n} = T_{L} =100 \)</span> and<span class="tex-text">\( T_{3}^{n} = T_{R} = 25 \)</span>. The only unknown temperature is <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{n}\)</span> . Since there are only two intervals, ∆x = L/2 = 0.8 cm = 0.008 m. The initial condition is that at <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0 T ( x = L /2 ,0) =T_{init} = 25 °C\)</span>. We now evolve this in time using the evolution Eq. (9.48). This becomes, for our case,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{n+1} = (1 &#8211; 2D) T_{2}^{n} + D (100+ 25)\)</span> (9.50)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The evolution of the temperature depends on the diffusion number D, which, in turn, depends on our choice of ∆t. We want our first solution at <span class="tex-text">\( Fo = \frac{\alpha t}{L^{2}} = 0.125 \)</span> . This corresponds to a time of <span class="tex-text">\( t = \frac{0.125 L^{2}}{\alpha } = 3.12 × 10^{-6} s. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Let us choose our time step ∆t such that we obtain the Fo = 0.125 solution in one time step. This corresponds to <span class="tex-text">\(D = \frac{\alpha ∆t}{∆x^{2}} = 10 × 3.12 × 10^{-6} / 0.008^{2} = 0.5\)</span>. For D = 0.5, Eq. (9.50) gives</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{1} = (1 &#8211; 2 ×0.5) T_{2}^{0} + 0.5 × (100+ 25)\)</span> (9.51)</p>
 <p class="blog">
That is, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{1}\)</span>= ° 62.5 °C, the average temperature of the ends at Fo = 0.125. You might suspect that something is not quite accurate here. After all, the mid-plane temperature</p>
 <p class="blog">
is supposed to be the average temperature only at steady state and not at early times such as Fo = 0.125. The reason we obtain this inaccurate temperature is because of the finite ∆x and ∆t that we are using. So, with numerical methods one always has to be careful about a certain amount of numerical error, as we have been seeing so far in this chapter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, we might ask, if we have already reached steady state at Fo = 0.125, what hap-pens beyond this time? Let us check. If we take one more time step with the same ∆t from here, we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{2} = (1 &#8211; 2 ×0.5) T_{2}^{1} + 0.5 × (100+ 25)\)</span> (9.52)</p>
 <p class="blog">
That is, <span class="tex-text">\( T_{2}^{2} \)</span>= ° 62.5 C , and the center-point stays at the steady state temperature, which is physically sound.<br /> A natural question to ask now is to see what happens as ∆t from the one we chose here. Let us take two extreme limits to understand what happens as ∆t → 0 and ∆t → ∞.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the lower limit of time steps, as ∆t → 0, D → 0 we obtain from Eq. (9.48), <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1} = T_{i}^{n}\)</span>.<br /> That is, the value at every point will be stuck at the initial value itself. Extrapolating from here, for very low time steps (D ≪ 0.5) we will obtain very slow convergence to steady state.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the upper extreme, as ∆t → ∞, we notice that D → ∞. We obtain from Eq. (9.48) that <span class="tex-text">\( T_{2}^{1} = T_{2}^{0} + D(100+ 25 &#8211; 2 × 25\)</span> . So, as D → ∞, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{1}\)</span> → ∞, which is obviously ab-surd. Reaching such unphysically large temperatures is called numerical instability, and one of the most common ways in which it occurs in numerical methods is by choosing large time steps. For FTCS on the one-dimensional conduction equation, one can prove that any choice of D &gt; 0.5 will ultimately result in unphysical tem-peratures. So, FTCS for one-dimensional conduction works only for 0 &lt; D ≤ 0.5. In general, it is important to remember that explicit schemes always work only under certain ranges of time steps. The determination of these ranges is typically covered in full-scale numerical methods courses, and we will avoid that here. In Table 9.4 there are the results of numerical experiments for various values of ∆t that are within the above stability range. You will notice that the solution gets more</p>

accurate as ∆t reduces. This is as predicted by the Taylor series analysis, which saysmthat the error is O (∆t , ∆x²) .<br /> What happens if we use FTCS but with five points in the domain now? Notice that our ∆x is now 0.004, and our error, therefore, should reduce. The scheme stays the same as before (see Eq. (9.48)). The difference now is that <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{n},T_{3}^{n},T_{4}^{n}\)</span> have to evolve at each time step. The results for the center temperature are given in Table 9.5. As expected, you can see that the prediction is better as ∆t and ∆x decrease.<br /> 6. Let us consider the same experiments as above, but with BTCS. We start with three points in the domain. Recall that, as before, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{1}^{n} = T_{L} = 100 °C \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(T_{3}^{n} = T_{R} = 25 °C \)</span>. The only unknown temperature is <span class="tex-text">\(T^{n}_{2}\)</span> . Since there are only two intervals, ∆x = L/2 = 0.8 cm = 0.008 m. The initial condition is that at <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0 T ( x = L /2,0)= T_{ init} = ° 25 C\)</span>. From Eq. (9.49), we obtain for the evolution of <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1} = \frac{T_{i}^{n}}{1+ 2D} + \frac{D}{1 + 2D}(T_{L} + T_{R})\)</span> (9.53)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Let us consider the two extreme cases, ∆t → 0 and ∆t → ∞ now. In the lower extreme, ∆t → 0, we obtain that <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1} = T_{i}^{n}\)</span> . That is, there is no evolution at all, since we are stuck at the same time. This is the same as it was in the explicit case. So, as we take smaller time steps, evolution will become slower.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What is interesting, however, is the other extreme case ∆t → ∞. In this case, D → ∞. Taking limits, we obtain <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{T_{i}^{n}}{1+ 2D} → 0\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{D}{1 + 2D} → \frac{1}{2}\)</span> . So we see that as ∆t → ∞, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}^{n+1} → \frac{T_{L} + T_{R}}{2}\)</span>.</p>

The above result is very useful for two reasons. Firstly, it is completely physical that the correct steady state temperature is reached as time tends to ∞. Secondly, we no longer seem to have the time step restrictions from which the explicit scheme suffered. That is, we may take as large a time step as we please without becoming unstable. Indeed, this is a major advantage of implicit schemes. Implicit schemes are usually stable for practically any time step.<br /> In the Table 9.6, we run some numerical experiments with the implicit BTCS and just three points in space.</p>

Let us now increase the number of points to five within the domain. Notice now that we have <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}^{n}, T_{3}^{n},T_{4}^{n}\)</span> as unknown points within the domain. At each time step, we see from Eq (9.49) that we have to solve a simultaneous system of equations for <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}, T_{3},T_{4}\)</span> . The equation is:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left[\begin{matrix} 1 + 2D &amp; -D &amp; 0 \\ -D &amp; 1 + 2D &amp; -D \\ 0 &amp; -D &amp; 1 + 2D \end{matrix} \right] \left\{\begin{matrix} T_{2} \\ T_{3} \\ T_{4} \end{matrix} \right\}^{(n)} = \left\{\begin{matrix} T_{2} \\ T_{3} \\ T_{4} \end{matrix} \right\}^{(n-1)} + D \left\{\begin{matrix} T_{1} \\ 0 \\ T_{5} \end{matrix} \right\}^{(n-1)}\)</span> <p class="blog">
For the first time step, this looks like</p>

For various values of D, the solutions are as follows (Table 9.7):<br /> Notice that we are able to use much larger time steps and also obtain good ac-curacy with the implicit scheme. This is particularly advantageous when we wish to obtain solutions in problems with very small, inherent timescales.</p>
