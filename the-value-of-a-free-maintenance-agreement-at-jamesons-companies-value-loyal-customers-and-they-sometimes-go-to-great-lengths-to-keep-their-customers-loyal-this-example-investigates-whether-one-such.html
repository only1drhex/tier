            <p class="blog"><strong>THE VALUE OF A FREE MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT AT JAMESONS</strong></p> <p class="blog">Companies value loyal customers, and they sometimes go to great lengths to keep their customers loyal. This example investigates whether one such plan is worth its cost. We consider a nationwide companycalled Jamesons, which sells electronicappliances. Specifically, we will focus on sales of smart phones. To attract customers, the company is considering giving customers a free maintenance agreement with each purchase of a smart phone. The unit profit without free maintenance is currently $75. The company believes this will decrease to $60 with free maintenance. Their thinking is that about 5% of customers will actually use the free maintenance, and for each such customer, the company will lose about $300. Hence the average decrease in profit per purchaser is about $15.</p> <p class="blog">Prior to this year, 50,000 customers were loyal to Jamesons and 100,000 customers were loyal to their competitors. (Loyalty is defined in terms of where the customer bought his or her last smart phone.) There are a number of uncertain quantities, and we assume they are all triangularly distributed. Their parameters (minimum, most likely, and maximum) are as follows. (1) The percentage of the 150,000 customers who purchase a smart phone in any given year has parameters 20%, 25%, and 40%. (2) The annual percentage change in unit profit has parameters 3%, 5%, and 6%. (3) In any year, the percentage of Jamesons’ loyal customers who remain loyal has parameters 56%, 60%, and 66% if there is no free maintenance, and they increase to 60%, 64%, and 70% with free maintenance. (4) Similarly, the percentage of the competitors’ loyal customers who switch to Jamesons has parameters 27%, 30%, and 34% if there is no free maintenance, and they increase to 32%, 35%, and 39% with free maintenance. These inputs are shown in the top section of Figure 16.31 below.</p> <p class="blog">Jamesons is hoping that the decrease in unit profit from the free maintenance agreement will be more than offset by the higher loyalty percentages. Using a 15-year planning horizon, does the NPV of profits with a 8% discount rate confirm the company’s hopes?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use simulation to see whether it makes sense for Jamesons to give a free maintenance agreement to DVD player purchasers.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">In the previous example, we discussed the switching rates, which would be estimated from extensive customer data. The other data in the problem statement are straightforward to obtain.</p>

The variables for this model are shown in Figure 16.30. (See the file Free Maintenance Big Picture.xlsx.) The solution strategy is to compare two simulations, one without free maintenance and one with it. Because they are so similar, you can use RiskSimtable to run both simulations. We make one assumption that is common in marketing but might not be intuitive. We assume that only purchasers in a given year have any chance of switching loyalty in the next year. For example, if a customer is loyal to Jamesons and doesn’t purchase a smart phone in a given year, this customer is automatically loyal to Jamesons in the next year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The completed simulation model appears in Figure 16.31. (See the file Free Maintenance 1 Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed with the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the given inputs in the blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Maintenance decision. The current “no free maintenance” policy is labeled simulation #1 and the proposed “free maintenance” policy is labeled simulation #2, so enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable({1,2})</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B21.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Percentages who purchase. We assume that each year a random percentage of Jamesons’ loyal customers and a random percentage of the competitors’ loyal customers purchase a DVD player. Each of these is generated from the triangular distribution in rows 9–11, so enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang($B$9,$B$10,$B$11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B24 and copy it to the range B24:Q25.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Percentage who stay or become loyal. Each year a random percentage of the customers previously loyal to Jamesons remain loyal, and a random percentage of the competitors’ previously loyal customers switch loyalty to Jamesons. Also, the distributions of these random percentages depend on the company’s maintenance policy. Therefore, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF($B$21=1,RiskTriang($G$8,$G$9,$G$10),RiskTriang($H$8,$H$9,$H$10))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C26, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF($B$21=1,RiskTriang($G$13,$G$14,$G$15),RiskTriang($H$13,$H$14,$H$15))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C27, and copy these across their rows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Numbers of loyal customers. Create links to cells B5 and B6 in cells B28 and B29. Then, remembering that only purchasers in a given year can switch loyalty, calculate the number of customers loyal to Jamesons in year 1 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B28*((1-B24)+B24*C26)+B29*B25*C27</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C28 and copy it across row 28. Similarly, calculate the number of customers loyal to the competitors in year 1 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B29*((1-B25)1B25*(1-C27))1B28*B24*(1-C26)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C29 and copy it across row 29. These are basic bookkeeping formulas. Jamesons’ loyal customers are those who (1) were loyal and didn’t purchase; (2) were loyal, purchased, and stayed loyal; and (3) weren’t loyal, purchased, and switched loyalty. Similar logic holds for the competitors’ loyal customers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Purchasers at Jamesons. Calculate the number of purchasers at Jamesons in year 1 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=C24*C28</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C30 and copy it across row 30.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. Monetary outcomes. These are straightforward. Start by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF($B$21=1,G5,H5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
for unit profit in year 1 in cell C32. Then enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang($B$14,$B$15,$B$16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=C32*(11D31)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=C32*C30</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells D31, D32, and C33, respectively, and copy them across their rows. Finally, calculate the NPV with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=NPV(B18,C33:Q33)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B35, and designate this as an @RISK output cell.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set up @RISK to run 1000 iterations and 2 simulations, one for each maintenance decision to be tested. Then run the simulation as usual.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong> Discussion of the Simulation Results </strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The summary measures for the two simulations appear in Figure 16.32. Using the current inputs, the free maintenance initiative does not look good. Every measure, except possibly the standard deviation, is worse with the free maintenance agreement (simulation 1) than without it (simulation 2). Evidently, the increase in loyal customers does not compensate for the decrease in unit profit. If Jamesons is confident about the inputs for this model, it should scrap the free maintenance idea. However, it might want to perform some sensitivity analysis on the decrease in unit profit or the increase in loyalty percentages (or both) to see when the free maintenance agreement starts looking attractive. We tried two possibilities. First, if the decrease in unit profit is only $7.50, not $15, and everything else remains the same, the two mean NPVs are very close, so the free maintenance agreement might be worth trying. Second, if the decrease in unit profit remains at $15, but all of the input percentages in the ranges H8:H10 and H13:H15 increase by five percentage points, the mean NPV with the free maintenance agreement is still slightly lower than the mean NPV without it. Evidently, the company can’t take this big a hit in its profit margin unless it can convince a lot more customers to stay or become loyal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is an interesting modeling issue in this example. For each of the random quantities, we have generated a new random value each year. Would it be better to generate one random number from each triangular distribution and use it for each year? Would it make a difference in the results? The modified simulation appears in the file Free Maintenance 2 Finished.xlsx. The summary measures from this simulation appear in Figure 16.33. If we are interested in comparing the mean NPV with no free maintenance versus free maintenance, we get about the same comparison in either model. The main difference between Figures 16.32 and 16.33 is the variability. Are you surprised that the models with more random numbers in Figure 16.32 have much smaller standard deviations than those in Figure 16.33? Evidently, there is an averaging effect. When different random numbers are used for each year, the highs and lows tend to cancel out, resulting in lower variability in NPV.</p>
