Road Map We begin by drawing an FBD of the entire beam and writing equilibrium equations to determine the reactions at A and B. To determine the internal forces throughout the beam, we will take a cut through a cross section (subsequently called cross section D), where this cross section has general (or variable) position in the beam. We will draw FBDs as needed and apply equilibrium equations to determine the shear and moment as functions of position.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling The FBD for the entire beam is shown in Fig. 2, where the distributed force has been replaced by an equivalent force consisting of a single 600 lb force placed at the centroid of the distributed force’s shape (i.e., centroid of a rectangle).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation Using the FBD shown in Fig. 2, we write and solve the following equilibrium equations to obtain the reactions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_A}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-(600 lb)(3 ft) + B_y(4 ft) = 0 \Rightarrow B_y = 450 lb\)</span>, (1)</p>

 <p class="blog">
Modeling To determine the internal forces throughout the beam, we consider cross section D, whose location is variable throughout the beam. As was done in Section 8.1, to determine the internal forces acting on cross section D, we take a cut that passes through this cross section, followed by construction of FBDs. Thus, when cross section D is located between points A and B, the two FBDs that result are shown in Fig. 3. A few important points regarding Fig. 3 are as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The length of the beam in the left-hand FBD is x, hence the force on this portion of the beam due to the distributed load is (100 lb/ft)x. Similarly, the length of the beam in the right-hand FBD is 6 ft-x, hence the force on this portion of the beam due to the distributed load is (100 lb/ft)(6 ft &#8211; x).</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The directions for the internal forces on both the left-hand and right-hand FBDs match the directions shown in Fig. 8.5(b) on p. 467.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation Either of the FBDs shown in Fig. 3 may be used to determine the internal forces acting on cross section D, and we will select the left-hand FBD. With some experience, we could have anticipated using this FBD, and we would have omitted drawing the FBD of the right-hand portion of the structure. We write and solve the following equations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-V &#8211; (100 lb/ft)x + 150 lb = 0\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow V = 150 lb &#8211; (100 lb/ft)x\)</span>, (5)</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_D}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(M + (100 lb/ft)x \frac{x}{2} &#8211; (150 lb)x = 0\)</span> (6)</p>

 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(N = 0 \Rightarrow N = 0\)</span>. (8)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results obtained in Eqs. (5), (7), and (8) are valid as long as the FBD is valid, which is all cross sections whose x coordinate lies in the region <span class="tex-text">\(0 \leq x \leq 4 ft\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling When cross section D is located between points B and C, the FBDs that result are shown in Fig. 4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation Either of the FBDs shown in Fig. 4 may be used to determine the internal forces acting on cross section D, and we will select the right-hand FBD. We write and solve the following equations.</p>

The results obtained in Eqs. (10), (12), and (13) are valid as long as the FBD is valid, which is for all cross sections whose x coordinate lies in the region <span class="tex-text">\(4 ft \leq x \leq 6 ft\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Discussion &amp; Verification The results for shear V and moment M are plotted in Fig. 5, where Eqs. (5) and (7) are used for <span class="tex-text">\(0 \leq x \leq 4 ft\)</span>, and Eqs. (10) and (12) are used for <span class="tex-text">\(4 ft \leq x \leq 6 ft\)</span>. These plots display some interesting features of internal forces:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The shear at x = 0 is equal to the support reaction <span class="tex-text">\(A_y\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The change in shear at x = 4 ft is equal to the support reaction <span class="tex-text">\(B_y\)</span>. That is, the shear just to the right of B (200 lb) minus the shear just to the left of B (-250 lb) is equal to <span class="tex-text">\(B_y\)</span> (450 lb).</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The shear at the right-hand end is zero, because this end is unsupported and has no concentrated force applied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The moment at x = 0 is zero, because the support at that location has no moment reaction.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The moment at the right-hand end is zero, because this end is unsupported and has no concentrated moment applied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The largest moment throughout the beam is -200 ft <span class="tex-text">\(\cdot\)</span> lb, which occurs at x = 4 ft. In mechanics of materials, this value will play an extremely important role in the design of the beam (i.e., determination of the material and cross-sectional shape for the beam). The values of the shear force are sometimes also important, especially for materials that are weak in shear, such as wood and some composite materials.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The largest value of the moment between A and B may be of interest. This value can be determined by evaluating Eq. (7), using trial and error with different values of x in the neighborhood of about 1.5 ft. However, a local maximum value of moment occurs where V = 0 (this is proved in Section 8.3).* Thus, we could solve Eq. (5) for the value of x that makes V = 0 and then substitute this value into Eq. (7) to obtain the moment. If you verify this for yourself, you should find that V = 0 at x = 1.5 ft and M = 112.5 ft<span class="tex-text">\(\cdot\)</span> lb at this location.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
*A local maximum value of the moment can also occur at an interval endpoint where V ≠ 0, such as at x = 4 ft in this example.</p>
