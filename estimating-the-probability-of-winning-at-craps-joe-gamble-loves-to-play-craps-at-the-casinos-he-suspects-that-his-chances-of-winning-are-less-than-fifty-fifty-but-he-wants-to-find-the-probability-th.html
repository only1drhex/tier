The simulation is of a single game. By running this simulation for many iterations, you can find the probability that Joe wins a single game of craps. If his intuition is correct (and surely it must be, or the casino could not stay in business), this probability is less than 0.5.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The simulation model is for a single game. (See Figure 16.40 and the file Craps Finished.xlsx. No “big picture” is provided for this model.) There is a subtle problem here: The number of tosses of the dice necessary to determine the outcome of a single game is unknown. Theoretically, the game could continue forever, with the player waiting for his point or a 7.However, it is extremely unlikely that more than, say, 40 tosses are necessary in a single game. (This can be shown by a probability argument not presented here.) Therefore, you can simulate 40 tosses and use only those that are necessary to determine the outcome of a single game. The steps required are as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Simulate tosses. Simulate the results of 40 tosses in the range B5:D44 by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RANDBETWEEN(1,6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B5 and C5 and the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(B5:C5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell D5. Then copy these to the range B6:D44. (Recall that the RANDBETWEEN function generates a random integer between the two specified values such that all values are equally likely, so it is perfect for tossing a die. You could also use @RISK’s RiskIntUniform function, which works exactly like RANDBETWEEN.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Function</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
RiskIntUniform</p>
 <p class="blog">
The @RISK function RiskIntUniform in the form =RiskIntUniform(N1,N2) works exactly like Excel’s RANDBETWEEN function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As in many spreadsheet simulation models, the concepts in this model are simple. The key is careful bookkeeping.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. First toss outcome. Determine the outcome of the first toss with the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(OR(D5=7,D5=11),1,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(OR(D5=2,D5=3,D5=12),1,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(AND(E5=0,F5=0),”Yes”,”No”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells E5, F5, and G5, respectively. Note that the OR condition checks whether Joe wins right away (in which case a 1 is recorded in cell E5). Similarly, the OR condition in cell F5 checks whether he loses right away. In cell G5, the AND condition checks whether both cells E5 and F5 are 0, in which case the game continues. Otherwise, the game is over.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Outcomes of other tosses. Assuming the game continues beyond the first toss, Joe’s point is the value in cell D5. Then he is waiting for a toss to have the value in cell D5 or 7, whichever occurs first. To implement this logic, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(OR(G5=”No”,G5=””),””,IF(D6=$D$5,1,0))</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(OR(G5=”No”,G5=””),””,IF(D6=7,1,0))</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(OR(G5=”No”,G5=””),””,IF(AND(E6=0,F6=0),”Yes”,”No”))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells E6, F6, and G6, respectively, and copy these to the range E7:G44. The OR condition in each formula checks whether the game just ended on the previous toss or has been over for some time, in which case blanks are entered. Otherwise, the first two formulas check whether Joe wins or loses on this toss. If both of these return 0, the third formula returns Yes (and the game continues). Otherwise, it returns No (and the game has just ended).</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Game outcomes. Keep track of two aspects of the game in @RISK output cells: whether Joe wins or loses and how many tosses are required. To find these, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(E5:E44)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=COUNT(E5:E44)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells J5 and J6, and designate each of these as an @RISK output cell. Note that both functions, SUM and COUNT, ignore blank cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Recall that the mean (or average) of a sequence of 0’s and 1’s is thefraction of 1’s in the sequence. This can typically be interpreted as a probability.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Simulation summary. Although you can get summary measures in the various @RISK results windows after you run the simulation, it is useful to see some key summary measures right on the model sheet. To obtain these, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMean(J5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell J8 and copy it to cell J9. As the labels indicate, the RiskMean in cell J8, being an average of 0’s and 1’s, is just the fraction of iterations where Joe wins. The average in cell J9 is the average number of tosses until the game’s outcome is determined.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set the number of iterations to 10,000 (partly for variety and partly to obtain a more accurate result) and the number of simulations to 1. Then run the simulation as usual.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
After running @RISK, the summary results in cells J8 and J9 of Figure 16.40 (among others) are available. Our main interest is in the average in cell J8. It represents the best estimate of the probability of winning, 0.495. (It can be shown with a probability argument that the exact probability of winning in craps is 0.493.) You can also see that the average number of tosses needed to determine the outcome of a game was about 3.34. (The maximum number of tosses ever needed on these 10,000 iterations was 25.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Perhaps surprisingly, the probability of winning in craps is 0.493, only slightly less than 0.5.</p>
