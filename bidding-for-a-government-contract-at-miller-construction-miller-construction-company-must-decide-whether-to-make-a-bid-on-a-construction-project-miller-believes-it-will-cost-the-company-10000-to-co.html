            <p class="blog"><strong>BIDDING FOR A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT AT MILLER CONSTRUCTION</strong></p> <p class="blog">Miller Construction Company must decide whether to make a bid on a construction project. Miller believes it will cost the company $10,000 to complete the project (if it wins the contract), and it will cost $350 to prepare a bid. However,there is uncertainty about each of these. Upon further reflection, Miller assesses that the cost to complete the project has a triangular distribution with minimum, most likely, and maximum values $9000, $10,000, and $15,000. Similarly, Miller assesses that the cost to prepare a bid has a triangular distribution with parameters $300, $350, and $500. (Note the skewness in these distributions. Miller recognizes that cost overruns are much more likely than cost underruns.) Four potential competitors are going to bid against Miller. The lowest bid wins the contract, and the winner is then given the winning bid amount to complete the project. Based on past history, Miller believes that each potential competitor will bid, independently of the others, with probability 0.5. Miller also believes that each competitor’s bid will be a multiple of its (Miller’s) most likely cost to complete the project, where this multiple has a triangular distribution with minimum, most likely, and maximum values 0.9, 1.3, and 1.8, respectively. If Miller decides to prepare a bid, its bid amount will be a multiple of $500 in the range $10,500 to $15,000. The company wants to use simulation to determine which strategy to use to maximize its expected profit.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To simulate the profit to Miller from any particular bid, and to see which bid amount is best.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The data required here are the parameters of the distributions of Miller’s costs, those of the competitors’ bids, and the probability that a given competitor will place a bid. Triangular distributions are chosen for simplicity, although Miller could try other types of distributions. The parameters of these distributions are probably educated guesses, possibly based on previous contracts and bidding experience against these same competitors. The probability that a given competitor will place a bid can be estimated from these same competitors’ bidding history.</p>

The logic is shown in Figure 16.1. (See the file Contract Bidding Big Picture.xlsx.) You first simulate the number of competitors who will bid and then simulate their bids. Then for any bid Miller makes, you see whether Miller wins the contract, and if so, what its profit is.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The simulation model appears in Figure 16.2. (See the file Contract Bidding Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed with the following steps. (Note that this model does not check the possibility of Miller not bidding at all. But this case is easy. If Miller opts not to bid, the profit is a certain $0.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Miller’s bid. You can test all of Miller’s possible bids simultaneously with the RiskSimtable function. To set up for this, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable(D16:M16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Recall that the RiskSimtable function allows you to run a separate<br /> simulation for each value in its list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B16. As with all uses of this function, the spreadsheet shows the simulated values for the first bid, $10,500. However, when you run the simulation, you see outputs for all of the bids.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Miller’s costs. Generate Miller’s cost to prepare a bid in cell B19 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang(B5,C5,D5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then copy this to cell B20 to generate Miller’s cost to complete the project.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Competitors and their bids. First, generate the random number of competitors who bid. This has a binomial distribution with four trials and probability of “success” equal to 0.5 for each trial, so enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskBinomial(B8,B9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B21. Then generate random bids for the competitors who bid in row 23 by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B22&lt;=$B$21,RiskTriang($B$12,$B$13,$B$14)*$C$6,””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B23 and copying across. This generates a random bid for all competitors who bid, and it enters a blank for those who don’t. (Remember that the random value is the multiple of Miller’s most likely cost to complete the project.) Calculate the smallest of these (if there are any) in cell B24 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B21&gt;=1,MIN(B23:E23),””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Of course, Miller will not see these other bids until it has submitted its own bid.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Win contract? See whether Miller wins the bid by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(OR(B16&lt;B24,B21=0),1,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B26. Here, 1 means that Miller wins the bid, and 0 means a competitor wins the bid. If there are no competing bids, Miller wins for sure. Then designate this cell as an @RISK output cell. Recall that to designate a cell as an @RISK output cell, you select the cell and then click the Add Output button on @RISK’s ribbon. You can then label this output appropriately. We used the label Wins Bid.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Miller’s profit. If Miller submits a bid, the bid cost is lost for sure. Beyond that, the profit to Miller is the bid amount minus the cost of completing the project if the bid is won. Otherwise, Miller makes nothing. So enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B26=1,B16-B20,0)-B19</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B27. Then designate this cell as an additional @RISK output cell. (We named it Profit.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set the number of iterations to 1000, and set the number of simulations to 10 because there are 10 bid amounts Miller wants to test.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The summary results appear in Figure 16.3. For each simulation—that is, each bid amount—there are two outputs: 1 or 0 to indicate whether Miller wins the contract and Miller’s profit. The only interesting results for the 091 output are in the Mean column, which shows the fraction of iterations that resulted in 1’s. So you can see, for example, that if Miller bids $12,000 (simulation #4), the probability of winning the bid is estimated to be about 0.57. This probability clearly decreases as Miller’s<br /> bid increases. The summary results appear in Figure 16.3.

This probability clearly decreases as Miller’s bid increases.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In terms of net profit, if you concentrate only on the Mean column, a bid amount of $13,500 (simulation #7) is the best. But as the other numbers in this figure indicate, the mean doesn’t tell the whole story. For example, if Miller bids $13,500, it could win the bid but still lose a considerable amount of money because of cost overruns. The histogram of profit in Figure 16.4 indicates this more clearly. It shows that in spite of the positive mean, many of the outcomes are negative. So what should Miller do? If it doesn’t bid at all, its profit is a certain $0. If Miller is an expected profit maximizer, then the fact that several of the means in Figure 16.3 are positive indicates that bidding is better than not bidding, with a bid of $13,500 being the best bid. However, potential cost overruns and the corresponding losses are certainly a concern. Depending on Miller’s degree of risk aversion, the company might decide to (1) not bid at all, or (2) bid higher than $13,500 to minimize its worse loss. Still, we would caution Miller not to be too conservative. Rather than focusing on the Min (worst case) column in Figure 16.3, we would suggest focusing on the 5% column. This shows nearly how bad things could get (5% of the time it would be worse than this), and this 5th percentile remains fairly constant for higher bids.</p>
