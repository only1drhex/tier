A good place to start is with a scatterplot of Cost versus Units. This appears in Figure 10.38. It indicates a definite positive relationship and one that is nearly linear. However, there is also some evidence of curvature in the plot. The points increase slightly less rapidly as Units increases from left to right. In economic terms, there might be economies of scale, so that the marginal cost of electricity decreases as more units of electricity are produced.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Nevertheless, you can first use regression to estimate a linear relationship between Cost and Units. The resulting regression equation is</p>
 <p class="blog">
Predicted Cost = 23651 + 30.53 Units</p>
 <p class="blog">
A scatterplot of residuals versus fitted values often indicates the need for a nonlinear transformation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The corresponding <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2} \text { and } s_{e}\)</span> are 73.6% and $2734. It is always a good idea to request a scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted values. This scatterplot is shown in Figure 10.39. Note that the residuals to the far left and the far right are all negative, whereas the majority of the residuals in the middle are positive. Admittedly, the pattern is far from perfect—there are<br /> several negative residuals in the middle—but this plot certainly suggests nonlinear behavior.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This negative–positive–negative behavior of residuals suggests a parabola—that is, a quadratic relationship with the square of Units included in the equation. The next step is to create a new variable (Units)^2 in the data set. You can do this manually with the formula 5C4^2 in cell D4, copied down. Alternatively, you can create the squared variable implicitly as a StatTools derived variable in the Regression dialog box. Then you can use multiple regression to estimate the equation for Cost with both explanatory variables, Units and (Units)^2, included. The resulting equation is shown in Figure 10.40. Note that <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> has increased to 82.2% and <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> has decreased to $2281.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One way to see how this regression equation fits the scatterplot of Cost versus Units (in Figure 10.38) is to use Excel’s Trendline option. To do so, activate the scatterplot, right-click on any point, select Add Trendline, and select the Polynomial type or order 2, that is, a quadratic. A graph of the best-fitting quadratic is superimposed on the scatterplot, as shown in Figure 10.41. It shows a reasonably good fit, plus an obvious curvature.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The main downside to a quadratic regression equation is that there is no easy way to interpret the coefficients of Units and (Units)^2. For example, you can’t conclude from the 98.35 coefficient of Units that Cost increases by 98.35 dollars when Units increases by one. The reason is that when Units increases by one, (Units)^2 doesn’t stay constant; it also increases. All you can say is that the terms in the quadratic combine to explain the nonlinear relationship between units produced and total cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Excel’s Trendline option allows you to superimpose a number of different curves on a scatterplot.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the coefficient of (Units)^2, about 20.06, is a small negative value. First, the fact that it is negative makes the parabola bend downward. This produces the decreasing marginal cost behavior, where every extra unit of electricity incurs a smaller cost. Actually, the curve in Figure 10.41 eventually goes downhill for large values of Units, but this part of the curve is irrelevant because the company evidently never produces such large quantities. Second, you should not be fooled by the small magnitude of this coefficient. Remember that it is the coefficient of Units squared, which is a large quantity. Therefore, the effect of the product 20.0600 (Units)^2 is sizable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is at least one other possibility you can examine. Rather than a quadratic fit, you can try a logarithmic fit. In this case you need to create a new variable, Log(Units), the natural logarithm of Units, and then regress Cost against the single variable Log(Units). To create the new variable, you can use a formula with Excel’s LN function or you can create a derived “log” variable in the StatTools Regression dialog box. Also, you can superimpose a logarithmic curve on the scatterplot of Cost versus Units by using Excel’s Trendline feature with the logarithm option. This curve appears in Figure 10.42. To the naked eye, it appears to be similar, and about as good a fit, as the quadratic curve in Figure 10.41.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resulting regression equation is listed in Figure 10.42. Its <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2} \text { and } s_{e}\)</span> values (the latter not shown) are 79.8% and 2393. These latter values indicate that the logarithmic fit is not quite as good as the quadratic fit. However, the advantage of the logarithmic equation is that it is easier to interpret. In fact, one reason logarithmic transformations of variables are used so widely in regression analysis is that they have a meaningful interpretation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In general, if b is the coefficient of the log of X, the expected change in Y when X increases by 1% is approximately 0.01 times b.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the present case, where the log of an explanatory variable is used, you can interpret its coefficient as follows. Suppose that Units increases by 1%, for example, from 600 to 606. Then the equation in Figure 10.42 implies that the expected Cost will increase by approximately 0.01(16654) = 166.54 dollars. In words, every 1% increase in Units is accompanied by an expected $166.54 increase in Cost. Note that for larger values of Units, a 1% increase represents a larger absolute increase (from 700 to 707 instead of from 600 to 606, for example). But each such 1% increase entails the same increase in Cost. This is another way of describing the decreasing marginal cost property.</p>
