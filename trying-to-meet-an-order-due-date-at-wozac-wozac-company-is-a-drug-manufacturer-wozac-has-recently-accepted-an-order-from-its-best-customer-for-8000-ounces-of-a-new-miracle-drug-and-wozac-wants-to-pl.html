            <p class="blog"><strong>TRYING TO MEET AN ORDER DUE DATE AT WOZAC</strong></p> <p class="blog">Wozac Company is a drug manufacturer. Wozac has recently accepted an order from its best customer for 8000 ounces of a new miracle drug, and Wozac wants to plan its production schedule to meet the customer’s promised delivery date ofDecember1. There arethree sources of uncertainty that make planning difficult. First, the drug must be produced in batches, and there is uncertainty in the time required to produce a batch, which could be anywhere from 5 to 11 days. This uncertainty is described by the discrete distribution in Table 16.1. Second, the yield (usable quantity) from any batch is uncertain. Based on historical data, Wozac believes the yield can be modeled by a triangular distribution with minimum, most likely, and maximum values equal to 600, 1000, and 1100 ounces, respectively. Third, all batches must go through a rigorous inspection once they are completed. The probability that a typical batch passes inspection is only 0.8. With probability 0.2, the batch fails inspection, and none of it can be used to help fill the order. Wozac wants to use simulation to help decide how many days prior to the due date it should begin production.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="334"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="334">Table 16.1 Distribution of Days to Complete a Batch</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Days</td> <td>Probability</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>0.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>0.10</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>0.20</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>0.30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>0.20</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>0.10</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>0.05</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

The variables for this model are shown in Figure 16.10. (See the file Drug Production Big Picture.xlsx.) The idea is to simulate successive batches their days to complete, their yields, and whether they pass inspection and keep a running total of the usable ounces obtained so far. IF functions can then be used to check whether the order is complete or another batch is required. You need to simulate only as many as batches as are required to meet the order, and you should keep track of the daysrequired to produce all of these batches. In this way, you can “back up” to see when production must begin to meet the due date. For example, if the simulation indicates that the order takes 96 days to complete, then production must begin on August 27, 96 days before the due date. (For simplicity, the model assumes that production occurs seven days a week.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong><br /> The completed model appears in Figure 16.11. (See the file Drug Production Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Batch indexes. We don’t know ahead of time how many batches will be required to fill the order. There should be enough rows in the simulation to cover the worst case that is likely to occur. After some experimentation, it is apparent that 25 batches are almost surely enough. Therefore, enter the batch indexes 1 through 25 in column A of the simulation section. (If 25 were not enough, you could always add more rows.) The idea, then, is to fill the entire range B16:F40 with formulas. However, you can use appropriate IF functions in these formulas so that if enough has already been produced to fill the order, blanks are inserted in the remaining rows. For example, the scenario shown in Figure 16.11 is one where 13 batches were required, so blanks appear below row 28.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Days for batches. Simulate the days required for batches in column B. To do this, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskDiscrete(G6:G12,H6:H12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(F16&lt;&gt;”No”,””,RiskDiscrete($G$6:$G$12,$H$6:$H$12))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B16 and B17, and copy the latter formula down to cell B40. The IF function enters a blank in this cell if there is not a No in column F for the previous batch, that is, if the order was just completed in the previous batch or it has been completed for some time. Similar logic appears in later formulas.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Batch yields. Simulate the batch yields in column C. To do this, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang(B9,C9,D9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(F16&lt;&gt;”No”,””,RiskTriang($B$9,$C$9,$D$9))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells C16 and C17, and copy the latter formula down to cell C40.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Pass inspection? Check whether each batch passes inspection with the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(RAND()&lt;Probability_pass,”Yes”,”No”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(F16&lt;&gt;”No”,””,IF(RAND()&lt;Probability_pass,”Yes”,”No”))</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can use Excel’s RAND function inside an IF function to simulate whether some event occurs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells D16 and D17, and copy the latter formula down to cell D40. Note that you could use @RISK’s RiskUniform(0,1) function instead of RAND(), but there is no real advantage to doing so. They are essentially equivalent. (Besides, the academic version of @RISK imposes an upper limit of 100 @RISK input functions per model, so it is often a good idea to substitute built-in Excel® functions when possible.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Order filled? To keep track of the cumulative usable production and whether the order has been filled in columns E and F, first enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(D16=”Yes”,C16,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(E16&gt;=Ounces_required,”Yes”,”Not yet”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells E16 and F16 for batch 1. Then enter the general formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(F16&lt;&gt;”No”,””,IF(D17=”Yes”,C17+E16,E16))</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(F16&lt;&gt;”No”,””,IF(E17&gt;=Ounces_required,”Yes”,”Not yet”))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells E17 and F17, and copy them down to row 40. Note that the entry in column F is “Not yet” if the order is not yet complete. In the row that completes the order, it changes to “Yes,” and then it is blank in succeeding rows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. Summary measures. Calculate the batches and days required in cells I15 and I16 with the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=INDEX(A16:A40,MATCH(”Yes”,F16:F40,0))</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(B16:B40)</p>
 <p class="blog">
These are the two cells used as output cells for @RISK, so designate them as such. Also, calculate the day the order should be started to just meet the due date in cell I17 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Due_date-I16</p>
 <p class="blog">
Date subtraction in Excel allows you to calculate the number of days between two given dates.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula uses date subtraction to find an elapsed time. (Again, the assumption is that production occurs every day of the week.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This completes the simulation model development. The other entries in columns H through J will be explained shortly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Dealing with Uncertain Timing</p>
 <p class="blog">
Many simulations that model a process over multiple time periods must deal with uncertain timing of events, such as when the manufacturing of an order will finish, which year sales of a new product will begin, and many others. Essentially, the spreadsheet model must generate random numbers that determine the timing and then play out the events. This can require tricky IF functions and possibly other functions. However, the hard work often involves getting the logic correct for only the first period or two. Then this logic can be copied down for the other periods. In other words, some time spent on developing the first row or two can result in a powerful model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of simulations to 1, and then run the simulation as usual.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
After running the simulation, you can obtain the distributions of the number of batches required and the number of days required in Figures 16.12 and 16.13.</p>
 <p class="blog">
How should Wozac use this information? The key questions are how many batches will be required and (2) when production should start. To answer these questions, it is helpful to use several of @RISK’s statistical functions. Recall that these functions can be entered directly into the Excel model worksheet. (Also, recall that they provide useful information only after the simulation has been run.) These functions provide no new information you don’t already have from other @RISK windows, but they allow you to see (and manipulate) this information directly in the spreadsheet.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the first question, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMax(Batches_required)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell I20. (Refer to Figure 16.11.) It shows that the worst case from the 1000 iterations, in terms of batches required, is 20 batches. (If this maximum were 25, you would add more rows to the simulation model and run the simulation again.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can answer the second question in two ways. First, you can calculate summary measures for days required and then back up from the due date. This is done in the range I22:J26. The formulas in column I are</p>
 <p class="blog">
=INT(RiskMean(Days_to_complete))</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMin(Days_to_complete)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskMax(Days_to_complete)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskPercentile(Days_to_complete,0.05)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskPercentile(Days_to_complete,0.95)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(The first uses the INT function to produce an integer.) You can then subtract each of these from the due date to obtain the potential starting dates in column J. Wozac should realize the pros and cons of these starting dates. For example, if the company wants to be 95% sure of meeting the due date, it should start production on August 2. In contrast, if Wozac starts production on September 21, there is only a 5% chance of meeting the due date.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Alternatively, you can get a more direct answer to the question by using @RISK’s RiskTarget function. This allows you to find the probability of meeting the due date for any starting date, such as the trial dates in the range L22:L26. To do it, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTarget(Days_to_complete,Due_date-L22)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell M22 and copy it down. This function returns the fraction of iterations where the (random) value in the first argument is less than or equal to the (fixed) value in the second argument. For example, you can see that 83.6% of the iterations have a value of days required less than or equal to 108, the number of days from August 15 to the due date.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using @RISK summary functions such as RiskMean, RiskPercentile,<br /> and others enables you to capture simulation results in the same work-sheet as the simulation model. These functions do not provide relevant results until the simulation is run.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What is our recommendation to Wozac? We suggest going with the 95th percentile— begin production on August 2. Then there is only a 5% chance of failing to meet the due date. But the table in the range L22:M26 also provides useful information. For each potential starting date, Wozac can see the probability of meeting the due date.</p>
