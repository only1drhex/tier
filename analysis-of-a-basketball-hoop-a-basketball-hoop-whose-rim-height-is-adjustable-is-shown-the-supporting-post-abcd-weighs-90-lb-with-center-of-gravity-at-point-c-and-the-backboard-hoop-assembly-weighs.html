Road Map To determine the support reactions at the base of the structure, we first draw an FBD of the entire structure, using a cut that passes through point D only, and we then write and solve the equilibrium equations for this FBD. To determine the forces supported by the individual members, we will draw FBDs of each member followed by writing and solving equilibrium equations for these.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling To determine the support reactions for the structure, we draw an FBD, using a cut that passes through the structure at point D only, as shown in Fig. 2. The 90 and 50 lb weights are vertical forces placed at their respective centers of gravity, and we assume the weights of the other components are negligible. We assume the person hanging on the rim is in static equilibrium and thus applies a 180 lb vertical force at point H.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation Using the FBD in Fig. 2, we write and solve the following equilibrium equations:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(D_x = 0 \Rightarrow D_x = 0\)</span>, (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(D_y &#8211; 90 lb &#8211; 50 lb &#8211; 180 lb = 0 \Rightarrow D_y = 320 lb\)</span>, (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_D}=0\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(M_D &#8211; (50 lb)(2.4 ft) &#8211; (180 lb)(4.5 ft) = 0\)</span>, (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \Rightarrow M_D = 930 ft\cdot lb.\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Modeling To determine the forces supported by the individual members, we draw FBDs for each member as shown in Fig. 3. These FBDs are constructed by first sketching the members. We then identify any two-force members and label their forces first. In Fig. 3, members AE and IJ are the only two-force members, and we label their forces as <span class="tex-text">\(T_{AE}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(T_{IJ}\)</span> , respectively. After the FBDs for the two-force members are completed, we add to the remaining FBDs the forces from the two-force members such that Newton’s third law is satisfied. That is, we apply force <span class="tex-text">\(T_{AE}\)</span> to the post ABCD, and to the backboard-hoop, making sure they are applied in directions opposite to the forces on member AE. Similarly, we apply force <span class="tex-text">\(T_{IJ}\)</span> to the post ABCD and to member IBF. The FBDs are completed by adding the support reactions at D and adding horizontal and vertical forces at pins where structural members are attached.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Governing Equations &amp; Computation By treating two-force members as described here, members AE and IJ automatically satisfy <span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0 , \sum{F_y}=0\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M}=0\)</span>. Of the three members remaining, the backboard-hoop assembly has the fewest unknowns (three), and thus we begin writing and solving equilibrium equations for it. Using the geometry shown in Fig. 1, the horizontal component of the force supported by member AE is <span class="tex-text">\(T_{AE}(2 ft) \sqrt{(2 ft)^2 + (1.6 ft)^2} = T_{AE}(2/2.561)\)</span>, and the vertical component is <span class="tex-text">\(T_{AE}(1.6/2.561)\)</span>. Thus, equilibrium equations can be written as</p>
 <p class="blog">
Member EFH:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_F}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(T_{AE}(\frac{2}{2.561})(1.6 ft) &#8211; (50 lb)(0.4 ft) &#8211; (180 lb)(2.5 ft) = 0\)</span>, (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow T_{AE} = 376.2 lb\)</span>, (6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(F_x &#8211; T_{AE}(\frac{2}{2.561}) = 0 \Rightarrow F_x = 293.8 lb\)</span>, (7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(F_y &#8211; T_{AE}(\frac{2}{2.561}) &#8211; 50 lb &#8211; 180 lb = 0 \Rightarrow F_y = 465.0 lb\)</span>. (8)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The FBDs remaining for members ABCD and IBF now have three unknowns each, and either could be considered next. We will use member IBF , and we write</p>
 <p class="blog">
Member IBF:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{M_B}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(T_{IJ} (0.5 ft) + F_x(1.6 ft) &#8211; F_y(2 ft) = 0\)</span>, (9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow T_{IJ} = 920.0 lb\)</span>, (10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_x}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(B_x = F_x = 0 \Rightarrow B_x = 293.8 lb\)</span>, (11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_y}=0\)</span>: <span class="tex-text">\(-T_{IJ} + B_y &#8211; F_y = 0 \Rightarrow B_y = 1385 lb\)</span>. (12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
With Eq. (12), all of the unknowns have been determined, and it is not necessary to write the equilibrium equations for the post ABCD.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Discussion &amp; Verification</p>
 <p class="blog">
• You should check that the solutions appear to be reasonable. In this problem the loading is simple enough that we expect members AE and IJ to be in tension, and indeed our solution shows this. By inspection, the reactions at the base of the post, point D, also have the proper signs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• In this solution we found the support reactions first. Doing this used three equilibrium equations, and thus it was possible to find all of the remaining unknowns without writing the equilibrium equations for the post ABCD. To help verify the solution’s accuracy, you could write and solve these equations and you should find that <span class="tex-text">\(D_x , D_y\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(M_D\)</span> agree with the results in Eqs. (1), (2), and (4).</p>
