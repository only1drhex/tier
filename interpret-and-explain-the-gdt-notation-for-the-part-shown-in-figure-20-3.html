Since this part has already been drawn, the five steps will be used to organize the explanation rather than to make the decisions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1 Select the datum features.<br /> The datum features that have been identified with the datum symbols are the back face and the left and bottom edges. The functional needs of the part are not specified, but this choice of datums is pretty common for this type of simple rectangular plate. Note that the callout for datum B is not placed in-line with the dimension, thus indicating the datum is at the edge of the part rather than the center plane of the part. Since the features are located with respect to the datum, the choice of datum indicates that it is more important to maintain the distance of the hole from the edge rather than to ensure that it is centered. The back face makes a good primary datum (as called out in the position control of the hole), as it is of sufficient size to stabilize the part with respect to three degrees of freedom while establishing the other datums. It is also likely that the back surface<br /> will be in contact with a mating part.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 Control the datum features.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A flatness specification ensures that the surface of datum feature A does not vary more than 0.003. This is a common control for a primary datum that is a planar surface, especially if it must fit with a mating surface. Datum feature B, the left surface of the part, is required to be perpendicular to the back face, within a toler-ance zone between two parallel planes separated by a distance of 0.005. Note that the envelope generated by this orientation control also constrains the form of this surface (e.g., flatness and straightness). Datum feature C must be perpendicular to datum features A and B, within a tolerance zone of 0.005.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3 Locate the features.</p>
 <p class="blog">
All features of this part are features of size, which are handled in the next step.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 Size and locate the features of size.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are four features of size: the hole, and the height, width, and thickness of the plate. The plate features do not need to be located, since each dimension starts at one of the datum features. Consequently, the three plate dimensions simply need a directly toleranced dimension.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The hole feature is located by basic dimensions from datums B and C. The hole diameter is specified to be within the range from 1.000 to 1.002. The position control on the hole stipulates that the center axis of the hole must be within a cylindrical tolerance zone that has a diameter of 0.003 if the hole is produced at its MMC of 1.000. The tolerance zone may increase to as much as 0.005 as the produced hole diameter increases from 1.000 to 1.002. The tolerance zone is determined with the part immobilized with respect to the three datums, applied in order of the back surface datum A, then the side edge datum B, then the lower edge datum C. Changing this order would change the location and orientation of the hole’s tolerance zone. Note that the hole’s tolerance zone, in addition to providing a tolerance on the location of the axis, also limits the orientation of the hole’s axis. A separate orientation control could have been stipulated if the same tolerance zone was not suitable for both position and orientation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5 Refine the orientation and the form of features, if needed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
No additional controls are specified, so apparently no further refinement is necessary. It is always a good idea to consider how far from the true geometry the part could be produced and still be within specifica-tions. For example, consider how out-of-flat the front face (opposite of datum A) could be. Since the thickness of the plate is a feature of size, the front face is controlled by Rule #1, that is, the size tolerance also establishes an envelope for form control. The size tolerance allows the thickness to vary between 1.9 and 2.1. Since the back datum face may vary only by 0.003, the majority of the size tolerance can be realized by a front face that is curved, bent, or wavy. The plate could be 1.9 thick on one edge and 2.1 thick on the other. If this is not acceptable, the Rule #1 control should be overruled by another more specific refinement.</p>
