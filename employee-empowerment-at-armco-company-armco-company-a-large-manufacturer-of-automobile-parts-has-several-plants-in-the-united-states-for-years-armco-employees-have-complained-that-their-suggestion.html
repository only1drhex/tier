            <p class="blog"><strong>EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AT ARMCO COMPANY</strong></p> <p class="blog">ArmCo Company, a large manufacturer of automobile parts, has several plants in the United States. For years, ArmCo employees have complained that their suggestions for improvements in the manufacturing processes have been ignored by upper management. In the spirit of employee empowerment, ArmCo management at the Midwest plant decided to initiate a number of policies to respond to employee suggestions. For example, a mailbox was placed in a central location, and employees were encouraged to drop suggestions into this box. No such initiatives were taken at the other ArmCo plants. As expected, there was a great deal of employee enthusiasm at the Midwest plant shortly after the new policies were implemented, but the question was whether life would revert to normal and the enthusiasm would dampen with time.</p> <p class="blog">To check this, 100 randomly selected employees at the Midwest plant and 300 employees from other plants were asked to fill out a questionnaire six months after the implementation of the new policies at the Midwest plant. Employees were instructed to respond to each item on the questionnaire by checking either a “yes” box or a “no” box. Two specific items on the questionnaire were the following:</p> <p class="blog">• Management at this plant is generally responsive to employee suggestions for improvements in the manufacturing processes.<br /> • Management at this plant is more responsive to employee suggestions now than it used to be.</p> <p class="blog">The results of the questionnaire for these two items appear in Figure 9.12. (See the file Empowerment.xlsx.) Note that the given data for this example are counts, not long Yes/No columns of individual observations. Does it appear that the policies at the Midwest plant are appreciated? Should ArmCo implement these policies in its other plants?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use a test for the difference between proportions to see whether a program of accepting employee suggestions is appreciated by employees.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2022/01/9.5-1-768x227.png"></div>

For either questionnaire item, let <span class="tex-text">\(p_{1}\)</span> be the proportion of “yes” responses that would be obtained at the Midwest plant if the questionnaire were given to all of its employees, and define <span class="tex-text">\(p_{2}\)</span> similarly for the other plants. Management certainly hopes to find a larger proportion of “yes” responses (to either item) at the Midwest plant than at the other plants, so the appropriate test is one-tailed, with the hypotheses set up as <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0}: p_{1}-p_{2} \leq 0 \text { versus } H_{ a }: p_{1}-p_{2}&gt;0\)</span> (These could also be written as <span class="tex-text">\(H_{0}: p_{1} \leq p_{2} \text { versus } H_{0}: p_{1}&gt;p_{2}\)</span>, but this has no effect on the test.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the counts in Figure 9.12, the test for either difference follows directly from Equations (9.5) and (9.6). The results are shown in Figure 9.13, with calculations made by the HT Proportion Diff sheet from the template file. (See the file Empowerment Finished.xlsx.)</p>

The p-values for the two tests (row 17) are 0.070 and 0.004. These results should be fairly good news for management. There is moderate, but not overwhelming, support for the hypothesis that management at the Midwest plant is more responsive than at the other plants, at least as perceived by employees. There is convincing support for the hypothesis that things have improved more at the Midwest plant than at the other plants. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the differences between proportions (not shown here) are included in the finished version of the file. Because they are almost completely positive, they support the hypothesis-test findings. Moreover, they provide a range of plausible values for the differences between the population proportions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The only real downside to these findings, from Midwest management’s point of view, is the sample proportion p^ 1 for the first item. Only 39% of the sampled employees at the Midwest plant believe that management generally responds to their suggestions, even though 68% believe things are better than they used to be. A reasonable conclusion by ArmCo management is that they are on the right track at the Midwest plant, and the policies initiated there ought to be initiated at other plants, but more must be done at all plants.</p>
