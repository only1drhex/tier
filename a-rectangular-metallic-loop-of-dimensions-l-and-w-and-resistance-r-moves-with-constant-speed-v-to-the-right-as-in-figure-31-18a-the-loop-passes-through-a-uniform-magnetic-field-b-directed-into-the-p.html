(A) Figure 31.18b shows the flux through the area enclosed by the loop as a function of x. Before the loop enters the field, the flux is zero. As the loop enters the field, the flux increases linearly with position until the left edge of the loop is just inside the field. Finally, the flux through the loop decreases linearly to zero as the loop leaves the field.<br /> (B) Before the loop enters the field, no motional emf is induced in it because no field is present (Fig. 31.18c). As the right side of the loop enters the field, the magnetic flux directed into the page increases. Hence, according to Lenzâ€™s law, the induced current is counterclockwise because it must produce its own magnetic field directed out of the page. The motional <span class="tex-text">\( emf -B \ell v \)</span> (from Eq. 31.5) arises from the magnetic force experienced by charges in the right side of the loop.<br /> When the loop is entirely in the field, the change in magnetic flux is zero, and hence the motional emf vanishes. This happens because, once the left side of the loop enters the field, the motional emf induced in it cancels the motional emf present in the right side of the loop. As the right side of the loop leaves the field, the flux begins to decrease, a clockwise current is induced, and the induced emf is <span class="tex-text">\( B \ell v \)</span>. As soon as the left side leaves the field, the emf decreases to zero.</p>

<span class="tex-text">\( E =-B \ell v \)</span> (31.5).</p>

(C) The external force that must be applied to the loop to maintain this motion is plotted in Figure 31.18d. Before the loop enters the field, no magnetic force acts on it; hence, the applied force must be zero if v is constant. When the right side of the loop enters the field, the applied force necessary to maintain constant speed must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the magnetic force exerted on that side. When the loop is entirely in the field, the flux through the loop is not changing with time. Hence, the net emf induced in the loop is zero, and the current also is zero. Therefore, no external force is needed to maintain the motion. Finally, as the right side leaves the field, the applied force must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the magnetic force acting on the left side of the loop.<br /> From this analysis, we conclude that power is supplied only when the loop is either entering or leaving the field. Furthermore, this example shows that the motional emf induced in the loop can be zero even when there is motion through the field! A motional emf is induced only when the magnetic flux through the loop changes in time.</p>
