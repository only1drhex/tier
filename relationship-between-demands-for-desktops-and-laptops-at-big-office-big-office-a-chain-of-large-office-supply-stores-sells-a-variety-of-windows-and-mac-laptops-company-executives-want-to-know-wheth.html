            <p class="blog"><strong>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMANDS FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS AT BIG OFFICE </strong></p> <p class="blog">Big Office, a chain of large office supply stores, sells a variety of Windows and Mac laptops. Company executives want to know whether the demands for these two types of computers are related in any way. They might act as complementary products, where high demand for Windows laptops accompanies high demand for Mac laptops (computers in general are hot), they might act as substitute products (demand for one takes away demand for the other), or their demands might be unrelated. Because of limitations in its information system, Big Office does not have the exact demands for these products. However, it does have daily information on categories of demand, listed in aggregate (that is, over all stores). These data appear in Figure 9.20. (See the file Laptop Demand.xlsx.) Each dayâ€™s demand for each type of computer is categorized as Low, Medium Low, Medium High, or High. The table is based on 250 days, so that the counts add to 250. The individual counts show, for example, that demand was high for both Windows and Mac laptops on 11 of the 250 days. For convenience, the row and column totals are provided in the margins. Based on these data, can Big Office conclude that demands for these two products are independent?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use the chi-square test of independence to test whether demand for Windows laptops is independent of demand for Mac laptops.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/9.7-768x198.png"></div>

The idea of the test is to compare the actual counts in the table with what would be expected under independence. If the actual counts are sufficiently far from the expected counts, the null hypothesis of independence can be rejected. The distance measure used to check how far apart they are, shown in Equation (9.9), is essentially the same chi-square statistic used in the chi-square test for normality. Here, <span class="tex-text">\(O_{i j}\)</span> is the actual count in cell i, j (row i, column j), <span class="tex-text">\(E_{i j}\)</span> is the expected count for this cell assuming independence, and the sum is over all cells in the table. If this test statistic is sufficiently large, the independence hypothesis can be rejected. (We provide more details of the test shortly.)</p>

What is expected under independence? The totals in row 9 indicate that demand for Windows laptops was low on 38 of the 250 days. Therefore, if you had to estimate the probability of low demand for Windows laptops, your estimate would be 38/250 = 0.152. Now, if demands for the two products were independent, you should arrive at this same estimate from the data in any of rows 5 through 8. That is, a probability estimate for Windows laptops should be the same regardless of the demand for Mac laptops. The probability estimate of low Windows demand from row 5, for example, is 4/43 = 0.093. Similarly, for rows 6, 7, and 8 it is 8/80 = 0.100, 16/70 = 0.229, and 10/57 = 0.175, respectively. These calculations provide some evidence that Windows and Mac laptops act as substitute productsâ€”the probability of low Windows demand is larger when Mac demand is medium high or high than when it is low or medium low.</p>

This reasoning is the basis for calculating the <span class="tex-text">\(E_{i j} s\)</span>. Specifically, it can be shown that the relevant formula for <span class="tex-text">\(E_{i j}\)</span> is given by Equation (9.10), where <span class="tex-text">\(R_{i}\)</span> is the row total in row i, <span class="tex-text">\(C_{i}\)</span>is the total in column j, and N is the number of observations. For example, <span class="tex-text">\(E_{11}\)</span> for these data is 43(38)/250 = 6.536, which is slightly larger than the corresponding observed count, <span class="tex-text">\(O_{11}=4\)</span>.</p>

The results appear in Figure 9.21. (Neither a template nor StatTools is required.) The formulas shown in the figure follow directly from Equations (9.9) and (9.10). The p-value of the test, 0.045, can be interpreted in the usual way. Specifically, the null hypothesis of independence can be rejected at the 5% or 10% significance levels, but not at the 1% level. There is a fairly strong evidence that the demands for the two products are not independent.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the alternative hypothesis of dependence is accepted, the output in Figure 9.22 can be used to examine its form. These two tables show the counts as percentages of row totals and as percentages of column totals. If the demands were independent, the rows of this first table should be identical, and the columns of the second table should be identical. This is because each row in the first table shows the distribution of Windows demand for a given category of Mac demand, whereas each column in the second table shows the distribution of Mac demand for a given category of Windows demand. A close study of these percentages again provides some evidence that the two products act as substitutes, but the evidence is not overwhelming.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Tables of counts expressed as percentages of rows or of columns are useful for judging the form (and extent) of any possible dependence.</p>
