            <p class="blog"><strong>DEVELOPING A NEW CAR AT GF AUTO</strong></p> <p class="blog">General Ford (GF) Auto Corporation is developing a new model of compact car. This car is assumed to generate sales for the next five years. GF has gathered information about the following quantities through focus groups with the marketing and engineering departments.</p> <p class="blog">• Fixed cost of developing car. This cost is assumed to be $600 million. The fixed cost is incurred at the beginning of year 1, before any sales are recorded.</p> <p class="blog">• Margin per car. This is the unit selling price minus the variable cost of producing a car. GF assumes that in year 1, the margin will be $4000. Every other year, GF assumes the margin will decrease by 4%.<span class="tex-text">\(^{1}\)</span></p> <p class="blog">• Sales. The demand for the car is the uncertain quantity. In its first year, GF assumes sales—number of cars sold—will be triangularly distributed with parameters 30,000, 55,000, and 65,000. Every year after that, the company assumes that sales will decrease by some percentage, where this percentage is triangularly distributed with parameters 5%, 8%, and 10%. GF also assumes that the percentage decreases in successive years are independent of one another.</p> <p class="blog">• Depreciation and taxes. The company will depreciate its development cost on a straight-line basis over the lifetime of the car. The corporate tax rate is 21%.</p> <p class="blog">• Discount rate. GF figures its cost of capital at 7%.</p> <p class="blog">Given these assumptions, GF wants to develop a simulation model that will evaluate its NPV of after-tax cash flows for this new car over the five-year time horizon.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To simulate the cash flows from the new car model, from the development time to the end of its life cycle, so that GF can estimate the NPV of after-tax cash flows from this car.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">There are many inputs to this problem. As we indicated, they are probably obtained from experts within the company and from focus groups of potential customers.</p> <p class="blog">1 The margin decreases because the company assumes variable costs tend to increase through time, whereas selling prices tend to remain fairly constant through time.</p>

The variables for the model are shown in Figure 16.14. (See the file New Car Development Big Picture.xlsx.) This model is like most financial multiyear spreadsheet models. The completed model extends several years to the right, but most of the work is for the first year or two. From that point, you can copy to the other years to complete the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The simulation model for GF appears in Figure 16.15. (See the file New Car Development Finished .xlsx.) It can be formed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the given inputs in the blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Unit sales. Generate first-year sales in cell B12 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang(E5,F5,G5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then generate the reduced sales in later years by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B12*(1-RiskTriang($E$6,$F$6,$G$6))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell C12 and copying it across row 12. Note that each sales figure is a random fraction of the previous sales figure.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Contributions. Calculate the unit contributions in row 13 by entering the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B5</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B13*(1-$B$6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B13 and C13, and copying the latter across. Then calculate the contributions in row 14 as the product of the corresponding values in rows 12 and 13.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Depreciation. Calculate the depreciation each year in row 15 as the development cost in cell B4 divided by 5. This is exactly what “straight-line depreciation” means.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Before-tax and after-tax profits. To calculate the before-tax profit in any year, subtract the depreciation from total contribution, so each value in row 16 is the difference between the corresponding values in rows 14 and 15. The reason is that depreciation isn’t taxed. To calculate the after-tax profits in row 17, multiply each before-tax profit by one minus the tax rate in cell B7. Finally, each cash flow in row 18 is the sum of the corresponding values in rows 15 and 17. Here depreciation is added back to get the cash flow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Depreciation is subtracted to get before-tax profit, but it is then added back after taxes have been deducted.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. NPV. Calculate the NPV of cash flows in cell B20 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=-B4+NPV(B8,B18:F18)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and designate it as an @RISK output cell (the only output cell). Here, we are assuming that the development cost is incurred right now, so that it isn’t discounted, and that all other cash flows occur at the ends of the respective years. This allows the NPV function to be used directly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of simulations to 1, and then run the simulation as usual.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
After running @RISK, you obtain the histogram in Figure 16.16. These results are somewhat comforting, but also a cause of concern for GF. On the bright side, the mean NPV is slightly more than $28 million, and there is some chance that the NPV could go well above that figure, even above $177 million. However, there is also a downside, as shown by the two sliders in the histogram. One slider has been placed over an NPV of 0. As the histogram indicates, there is a 65.9% chance of a positive NPV, but there is a 34.1% chance of it being negative. The second slider has been positioned at its default 5th percentile setting. Financial analysts often call this percentile the value at risk at the 5% level, or VaR 5%, because it indicates nearly the worst possible outcome. From this simulation, you can see that GF’s VaR 5% is approximately a $111.77 million loss.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The value at risk at the 5% level, or VaR 5%, is the 5th percentile of a distribution, and it is often used in financial models. It indicates nearly the worst possible outcome.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Financial analysts typically look at VaR 5% to see how bad—or more precisely, almost how bad—things could get.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What is most responsible for this huge variability in NPV, the variability in first-year sales or the variability in annual sales decreases? This can be answered with @RISK’s tornado graph, which lets you see which random inputs have the most effect on a specified output. (See Figure 16.17.) To get this graph, click the tornado button below the histogram in Figure 16.16 and select the Change in Output Mean option. This graph answers the question emphatically. Variability in first-year sales is by far the largest influence on NPV. It is very highly correlated with NPV. The annual decreases in sales are important, but they have much less effect on NPV. If GF wants to get a more favorable NPV distribution, it should do all it can to boost first-year sales—and make the first-year sales distribution less variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before finishing this example, we revisit the flaw of averages. What if GF used a deterministic model to estimate NPV? Would the results match those from the simulation? We tried this two ways, once by entering the most likely values of the inputs instead of the random numbers, and once by entering the means instead of the random numbers. The results (not shown here) are available in the last sheet of the finished version of the file. As you can check, the difference between the two NPVs is huge. In this case, the NPV by using means is very close to the mean NPV from the simulation, about $28 million. But if the company used most likely values for the inputs in its deterministic model, which certainly seems sensible, the NPV would be about $77 million, off by a factor of more than two, another variation of the flaw of averages. Besides this problem, neither deterministic model provides even a hint that the company has about a 34.1% chance of a negative NPV.<span class="tex-text">\( ^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
If you create a deterministic model using the most likely values of the uncertain inputs, you can possibly get an output value that is nowhere near the mean of that output.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 It turns out that the NPV in this model is linear in the two random inputs. When an output is linear in the inputs, the deterministic model using means of inputs always gives the correct mean output (aside from some randomness), so that the flaw of averages in the form from the previous chapter does not occur. Even so, a deterministic model still provides no indication of how bad or how good things could get.</p>
