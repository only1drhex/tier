The Mulvaney family has two wage earners who have held their present jobs for 18 months. They have lived at their current street address for one year, where they rent on a six month lease. Their credit report is excellent but shows only one previous charge. However, they are actively using two credit cards right now to help with household expenses. Yesterday, they opened an account at San Carlos and deposited $250. The Mulvaneys have asked for a $4,500 loan to purchase a used car and some furniture. The bank has a cutoff score in its scoring system of 30 points. Would you make this loan for two years as they have requested? Are there factors not included in the scoring system that you would like to know more about? Please explain.</p>

The Mulvaney family has a point total of 31. San Carlos Bank and Trust has a cutoff score of 30 points so the Mulvaneys are likely to receive their loan.</p>
