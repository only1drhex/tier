For the coming month, the company wants to decide how many of each model to assemble and then test. No computers are in inventory from the previous month, and because these models are going to be changed after this month, the company doesn’t want to hold any inventory after this month. It believes the most it can sell this month are 600 Basics and 1200 XPs. Each Basic sells for $300 and each XP sells for $450. The cost of component parts for a Basic is $150; for an XP it is $225. Labor is required for assembly and testing. There are at most 10,000 assembly hours and 3000 testing hours available. Each labor hour for assembling costs $11 and each labor hour for testing costs $15. Each Basic requires five hours for assembling and one hour for testing, and each XP requires six hours for assembling and two hours for testing. PC Tech wants to know how many of each model it should produce (assemble and test) to maximize its net profit, but it cannot use more labor hours than are available, and it does not want to produce more than it can sell.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use LP to find the best mix of computer models that stays within the company’s<br /> labor availability and maximum sales constraints.</p>

In all optimization models, you are given a variety of numbers—the inputs—and you are asked to make some decisions that optimize an objective, while satisfying all constraints. As in Chapter 2, we use drawings from Palisade’s BigPicture add-in to show this information, as shown in Figure 3.1. (See the file Product Mix 1 Big Picture.xlsx.) Remember that you can view this more dynamically by opening the big picture file in Excel, along with the BigPicture add-in, and playing its slide show.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The decision variables in this product mix model are fairly obvious. The company must choose two numbers: how many Basics to produce and how many XPs to produce. Once these are known, they can be used, along with the problem inputs, to calculate the number of computers sold, the labor used, and the revenue and cost. However, as you will see with other models in this chapter and the next few chapters, determining the decision variables is not always this obvious.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>An Algebraic Model</strong><br /> In the traditional algebraic solution method, you first identify the decision variables<span class="tex-text">\(.^{2}\)</span> In this small problem they are the numbers of computers to produce. We label these <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>,</p>
 <p class="blog">
although any other labels would do. The next step is to write expressions for the total net profit and the constraints in terms of <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span>and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>. Finally, because only nonnegative amounts can be produced, explicit constraints are added to ensure that <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>are nonnegative. The resulting algebraic model is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Maximize <span class="tex-text">\(80x_{1} + 129x_{2}\)</span><br /> subject to:<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(5x_{1} + 6x_{2} ≤ 10000\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}+ 2x_{2} ≤ 3000\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}≤ 600\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} ≤ 1200\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}, x_{2} ≥ 0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
To understand this model, consider the objective first. Each Basic produced sells for $300, and the total cost of producing it, including component parts and labor, is 150 + 5(11) + 1(15) 5 $220, so the profit margin is $80. Similarly, the profit margin for an XP is $129. Each profit margin is multiplied by the number of computers produced and these products are then summed over the two computer models to obtain the total net profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first two constraints are similar. For example, each Basic requires five hours for assembling and each XP requires six hours for assembling, so the first constraint says that the total hours required for assembling is no more than the number available, 10,000. The third and fourth constraints are the maximum sales constraints for Basics and XPs. Finally, negative amounts cannot be produced, so nonnegativity constraints on <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span>and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>are included.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For many years all LP problems were modeled this way in textbooks. In fact, many commercial LP computer packages are still written to accept LP problems in essentially this format. Since around 1990, however, a more intuitive method of expressing LP problems has emerged. This method takes advantage of the power and flexibility of spreadsheets. Actually, LP problems could always be modeled in spreadsheets, but now with the addition of the Solver add-in, Excel LP models can be solved—that is, optimized—as well. We use Excel’s Solver for all optimization examples in this book<span class="tex-text">\(.^{3}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>A Graphical Solution</strong><br /> When there are only two decision variables in an LP model, as there are in this product mix model, you can solve the problem graphically. Although this graphical solution approach is not practical in most realistic optimization models—where there are many more than two decision variables—the graphical procedure illustrated here still yields important insights for general LP models.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In general, if the two decision variables are labeled <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span>and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>, then the steps of the method are to express the constraints and the objective in terms of <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span>and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} \)</span>, graph the constraints to find the feasible region [the set of all pairs (<span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}, x_{2}\)</span>) satisfying the constraints, where <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span>is on the horizontal axis and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>is on the vertical axis], and then move the objective through the feasible region until it is optimized.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To do this for the product mix problem, note that the constraint on assembling labor hours can be expressed as <span class="tex-text">\(5x_{1} + 6x_{2} ≤ 10000\)</span>. To graph this, consider the associated equality (replacing ≤ with =) and find where the associated line crosses the axes. Specifically, when <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span> = 0, then <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}= 10000/6= 1666.7\)</span>, and when <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span> = 0, then <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}= 10000/5 = 2000\)</span>. This provides<br /> the line labeled “assembling hour constraint” in Figure 3.2. It has slope 25/6 = -0.83. The set of all points that satisfy the assembling hour constraint includes the points on this line plus the points below it, as indicated by the arrow drawn from the line. (The feasible points are below the line because the point (0, 0) is obviously below the line, and (0, 0) clearly satisfies the assembly hour constraint.) Similarly, the testing hour and maximum sales constraints can be graphed as shown in the figure. The points that satisfy all three of these constraints and are nonnegative comprise the feasible region, which is below the dark lines in the figure.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To see which feasible point maximizes the objective, it is useful to draw a sequence of lines where, for each, the objective is a constant. A typical line is of the form <span class="tex-text">\(80x_{1} + 129x_{2} =5 c\)</span>, where c is a constant. Any such line has slope <span class="tex-text">\(-80/129 = 20.620\)</span>, regardless of the value of c. This line is steeper than the testing hour constraint line (slope -0.5), but not as steep as the assembling hour constraint line (slope -0.83). The idea now is to move a line with this slope up and to the right, making c larger, until it just barely touches the feasible region. The last feasible point that it touches is the optimal point.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Several lines with slope -20.620 are shown in Figure 3.2. The middle dotted line is the one with the largest net profit that still touches the feasible region. The associated optimal point is clearly the point where the assembling hour and XP maximum sales lines intersect. You will eventually find (from Solver) that this point is (560,1200), but even if you didn’t have the Solver add-in, you could find the coordinates of this point by solving two equations (the ones for assembling hours and XP maximum sales) in two unknowns.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Again, the graphical procedure illustrated here can be used only for the simplest of LP models, those with two decision variables. However, the type of behavior pictured in Figure 3.2 generalizes to all LP problems. In general, all feasible regions are (the multidimensional versions of) polygons. That is, they are bounded by straight lines (actually hyperplanes) that intersect at several corner points. There are five corner points in Figure 3.2, three of which are on the axes. [One of them is (0,0).] When the dotted objective line is moved as far as possible toward better values, the last feasible point it touches is one of the corner points. The actual corner point it last touches is determined by the slopes of the objective and constraint lines. Because there are only a finite number of corner points, it suffices to search among this finite set, not the infinite number of points in the entire feasible region<span class="tex-text">\(.^{4}\)</span> This insight is largely responsible for the efficiency of the simplex method for solving LP models.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong><br /> Geometry of LP Models and the Simplex Method<br /> The feasible region in any LP model is always a multidimensional version of a polygon, and the objective is<br /> always a hyperplane, the multidimensional version of a straight line. The objective should always be moved as far as possible in the maximizing or minimizing direction until it just touches the edge of the feasible region. Because of this geometry, the optimal solution is always a corner point of the polygon. The simplex method for LP models works so well because it can search through the finite number of corner points extremely efficiently and recognize when it has found the best corner point. This rather simple insight, plus its clever implementation in software packages, has saved companies many, many millions of dollars in the past 50 years.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
A Spreadsheet Model<br /> We now turn our focus to spreadsheet modeling. There are many ways to develop an LP spreadsheet model. Everyone has his or her own preferences for arranging the data in the various cells. We do not provide exact prescriptions, but we do present enough examples to help you develop good habits. The common elements in all LP spreadsheet models are the inputs, decision variable cells, objective cell, and constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ Inputs. All numerical inputs—that is, all numeric data given in the statement of the problem—should appear somewhere in the spreadsheet. Our convention is to color all of the input cells blue. We also try to put most of the inputs in the upper left section of the spreadsheet. However, we sometimes violate this latter convention when certain inputs fit more naturally somewhere else.<br /> ■ Decision variable cells. Instead of using variable names, such as <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1}\)</span>and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2}\)</span>, spreadsheet models use a set of designated cells for the decision variables. The values in these decision variable cells can be changed to optimize the objective. The values in these cells must be allowed to vary freely, so there should not be any formulas in the decision variable cells. To designate them clearly, our convention is to color them red.<br /> ■ Objective cell. One cell, called the objective cell, contains the value of the objective. Solver systematically varies the values in the decision variable cells to optimize the value in the objective cell. This cell must be linked, either directly or indirectly, to the decision variable cells by formulas. Our convention is to color the objective cell gray<span class="tex-text">\(.^{5}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Our coloring conventions</p>
 <p class="blog">
Color all input cells blue (appears light blue on the printed page). Color all of the decision variable cells red (appears deep blue on the printed page).Color the objective cell gray.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ Constraints. Excel does not show the constraints directly on the spreadsheet. Instead, they are specified in a Solver dialog box, to be discussed shortly. For example, a set of related constraints might be specified by<br /> B16:C16&lt;=B18:C18<br /> This implies two separate constraints. The value in B16 must be less than or equal to the value in B18, and the value in C16 must be less than or equal to the value in C18. We will always assign range names to the ranges that appear in the constraints. Then a typical constraint might be specified as<br /> Number_to_produce&lt;=Maximum_sales<br /> This is much easier to read and understand. (If you find that range names take too long to create, you certainly do not have to use them. Solver models work fine with cell addresses only.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ Nonnegativity. Normally, the decision variables—that is, the values in the decision variable cells—must be nonnegative. These constraints do not need to be written explicitly; you simply check an option in the Solver dialog box to indicate that the decision variable cells should be nonnegative. Note, however, that if you want to constrain any other cells to be nonnegative, you must specify these constraints explicitly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Overview of the Solution Process</strong><br /> As mentioned previously, the complete solution of a problem involves three stages. In the model development stage you enter all of the inputs, trial values for the decision variable ells, and formulas relating these in a spreadsheet. This stage is the most crucial because it is here that all of the ingredients of the model are included and related appropriately. In particular, the spreadsheet must include a formula that relates the objective to the decision variable cells, either directly or indirectly, so that if the values in the decision variable cells change, the objective value changes accordingly. Similarly, the spreadsheet must include formulas for the various constraints (usually their left sides) that are related directly or indirectly to the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
After the model is developed, you can proceed to the second stage—invoking Solver. At this point, you formally designate the objective cell, the decision variable cells, the constraints, and selected options, and you tell Solver to find the optimal solution. If the first stage has been done correctly, the second stage is usually very straightforward. The third stage is sensitivity analysis. Here you see how the optimal solution changes (if at all) as selected inputs are varied. This often provides important insights about the behavior of the model. We now illustrate this procedure for</p>
 <p class="blog">
the product mix problem in Example 3.1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> Textbooks typically state a problem, including a number of input values, and proceed directly to a solution—without saying where these input values might come from. However, finding the correct input values can sometimes be the most difficult step in a real-world situation. (Recall that finding the necessary data is step 2 of the overall modeling process, as discussed in Chapter 1.) There are a variety of inputs in PC Tech’s problem, some easy to find and others more difficult. Here are some ideas on how they might be obtained.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ The unit costs in rows 3, 4, and 10 should be easy to obtain. (See Figure 3.3.) These are the going rates for labor and the component parts. Note, however, that the labor costs are probably regular-time rates. If the company wants to consider overtime hours, then the overtime rate (and labor hours availability during overtime) would be necessary, and the model would need to be modified.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ The resource usages in rows 8 and 9, often called technological coefficients, should be available from the production department. These people know how much labor it takes to assemble and test these computer models.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ The unit selling prices in row 11 have actually been chosen by PC Tech’s management, probably in response to market pressures and the company’s own costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ The maximum sales values in row 18 are probably forecasts from the marketing and sales department. These people have some sense of how much they can sell, based on current outstanding orders, historical data, and the prices they plan to charge.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ The labor hour availabilities in rows 21 and 22 are probably based on the current workforce size and possibly on new workers who could be hired in the short run. Again, if these are regular-time hours and overtime is possible, the model would have to be modified to include overtime. ( in the next chapter illustrates Developing the Spreadsheet Model The spreadsheet model appears in Figure 3.3. (See the file Product Mix 1 Finished.xlsx.) To develop this model, use the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Inputs. Enter all of the inputs from the statement of the problem in the light blue cells as shown. an aggregate planning model where overtime is allowed.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Range names. Create the range names shown in columns E and F. Our convention is to enter enough range names, but not to go overboard. Specifically, we enter enough range names so that the setup in the Solver dialog box, to be explained shortly, is entirely in terms of range names. Of course, you can add more range names if you like (or you can omit them altogether). The following tip indicates a quick way to create range names.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Shortcut for Creating Range Names<br /> Select a range such as A16:C16 that includes nice labels in column A and the range you want to name in columns B and C. Then, from the Formulas ribbon, select Create from Selection and accept the default. You automatically get the labels in cells A16 as the range name for the range B16:C16. This shortcut illustrates the usefulness of adding concise but informative labels next to ranges you want to name.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Unit margins. Enter the formula<br /> =B11-B8*$B$3-B9*$B$4-B10<br /> in cell B12 and copy it to cell C12 to calculate the unit profit margins for the two models. (As discussed in the previous chapter, you should enter relative/absolute addresses that allow you to copy whenever possible.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Decision variable cells. Enter any two values for the decision variable cells in the Number_to_produce range. Any trial values can be used initially; Solver eventually finds the optimal values. Note that the two values shown in Figure 3.3 cannot be optimal because they use more assembling hours than are available. However, you do not need to worry about satisfying constraints at this point; Solver takes care of this later on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Labor hours used. To operationalize the labor availability constraints, you must calculate the amounts used by the production plan. To do this, enter the formula =SUMPRODUCT(B8:C8,Number_to_produce)<br /> in cell B21 for assembling and copy it to cell B22 for testing. This formula is a shortcut for the following fully written out formula:<br /> =B8*B16+C8*C16<br /> The SUMPRODUCT function is very useful in spreadsheet models, especially LP models, and you will see it often. Here, it multiplies the number of hours per computer by the number of computers for each model and then sums these products over the two models. When there are only two products in the sum, as in this example, the SUMPRODUCT formula is not really any simpler than the written-out formula. However, imagine that there are 50 computer models. Then the SUMPRODUCT formula is much simpler to enter (and read). For this reason, you should use it whenever possible. Note that each range in this function, B8:C8 and Number_to_produce, is a one-row, two-column range. It is important in the SUMPRODUCT function that the two ranges be exactly the same size and shape.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) Net profits. Enter the formula<br /> =B12*B16<br /> in cell B25, copy it to cell C25, and sum these to get the total net profit in cell D25. This latter cell is the objective to maximize. Note that if you didn’t care about the net profits for the two individual models, you could calculate the total net profit with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B12:C12,Number_to_produce)<br /> As you see, the SUMPRODUCT function appears once again. It and the SUM function are the most used functions in LP models.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Experimenting with Possible Solutions</strong><br /> The next step is to specify the decision variable cells, the objective cell, and the constraints in a Solver dialog box and then instruct Solver to find the optimal solution. However, before you do this, it is instructive to try a few guesses in the decision variable cells. There are two reasons for doing so. First, by entering different sets of values in the decision variable cells, you can confirm that the formulas in the other cells are working correctly. Second, this experimentation can enhance your understanding of the model.<br /> For example, the profit margin for XPs is much larger than for Basics, so you might suspect that the company will produce only XPs. The most it can produce is 1200 (maximum sales), and this uses fewer labor hours than are available. This solution appears in Figure 3.4. However, you can probably guess that it is far from optimal. There are still many labor hours available, so the company could use them to produce some Basics and make more profit.<br /> You can continue to try different values in the decision variable cells, attempting to get as large a total net profit as possible while staying within the constraints. Even for this small model with only two decision variable cells, the optimal solution is not totally obvious. You can only imagine how much more difficult it is when there are hundreds or even thousands of decision variable cells and many constraints. This is why software such as Excel’s Solver is required. Solver uses a quick and efficient algorithm to search through all feasible solutions (or more specifically, all corner points) and eventually find the optimal solution. Fortunately, it is quite easy to use, as we now explain.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> To invoke Excel’s Solver, select Solver from the Data ribbon. (If there is no such item on your computer, you need to load Solver. To do so, click the File tab, then Options [or the Office button, then Excel Options in Excel 2007], then Add- Ins, and then Go at the bottom of the dialog box. This shows you the list of available add-ins. If there is a Solver Add-in item in the list, check it to load Solver. If there is no such item, you need to rerun the Microsoft Office installer and elect to install Solver. It should be included in a typical install, but some people elect not to install it the first time around.) The dialog box in Figure 3.5 appears<span class="tex-text">\(.^{6}\)</span> It has three important sections that you must fill in:<br /> the objective cell, the decision variable cells, and the constraints. For the product mix model, you can fill these in by typing cell references or you can point, click, and drag the appropriate ranges in the usual way. Better yet, if there are any named ranges, these range names appear instead of cell addresses when you drag the ranges. In fact, for reasons of readability, our convention is to use only range names, not cell addresses, in this dialog box.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Range Names in Solver Dialog Box<br /> Our usual procedure is to use the mouse to select the relevant ranges for the Solver dialog box. Fortunately, if these ranges have already been named, then the range names will automatically replace the cell addresses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Objective. Select the Total_profit cell as the objective cell, and check the Max option. (Actually, the default option is Max.)<br /> 2) Decision variable cells. Select the Number_to_produce range as the decision variable cells (under the “By Changing Variable Cells:” heading).<br /> 3) Constraints. Click the Add button to bring up the dialog box in Figure 3.6. Here you specify a typical constraint by entering a cell reference or range name on the left, the type of constraint from the dropdown list in the middle, and a cell reference, range name, or numeric value on the right. Use this dialog box to enter the constraint</p>
 <p class="blog">
Number_to_produce&lt;=5Maximum_sales<br /> (Note: You can type these range names into the dialog box, or you can drag them in the usual way. If you drag them, the cell addresses shown in the figure eventually change into range names if range names exist.) Then click the Add button and enter the constraint<br /> Hours_used&lt;=Hours_available<br /> Then click OK to get back to the Solver dialog box. The first constraint says to produce no more than can be sold. The second constraint says to use no more labor hours than are available.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Inequality and Equality Labels in Spreadsheet Models<br /> The &lt;= signs in cells B17:C17 and C21:C22 (see Figure 3.3 or Figure 3.4) are not a necessary part of the Excel model. They are entered simply as labels in the spreadsheet and do not substitute for entering the constraints in the Add Constraint dialog box. However, they help to document the model, so we include them in all of the examples. In fact, you should try to plan your spreadsheet models so that the two sides of a constraint are in nearby cells, with cells in between where you can attach labels like &lt;=, &gt;=, or =. This convention tends to make the resulting spreadsheet models much more readable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Solver Tip</strong>: Entering Constraints in Groups<br /> Constraints typically come in groups. Beginners often enter these one at a time, such as B16&lt;=B18 and C16&lt;=C18, in the Solver dialog box. This can lead to a long list of constraints, and it is time-consuming. It is better to enter them as a group, as in B16:C16&lt;=B18:C18. This is not only quicker, but it also takes advantage of range names you have created. For example, this group ends up as Number_to_produce ≤ Maximum_Sales.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Nonnegativity. Because negative production quantities make no sense, you must tell Solver explicitly to make the decision variable cells nonnegative. To do this, check the Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative option shown in Figure 3.5. This automatically ensures that all decision variable cells are nonnegative. (In pre-2010 versions of Solver, you have to click the Options button and then check the Assume Non-Negative option in the resulting dialog box.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Linear model. There is one last step before clicking the Solve button. As stated previously, Solver uses one of several numerical algorithms to solve various types of models. The models discussed in this chapter are all linear models. (We will discuss the properties that distinguish linear models shortly.) Linear models can be solved most efficiently with the simplex method. To instruct Solver to use this method, make sure Simplex LP is selected in the Select a Solving Method dropdown list in Figure 3.5. (In pre-2010 versions of Solver, you have to click the Options button and then check the Assume Linear Model option in the resulting dialog box. In fact, from now on, if you are using a pre-2010 version of Excel and we instruct you to use the simplex method, you should check the Assume Linear Model option. In contrast, if we instruct you to use a nonlinear algorithm, you should uncheck the Assume Linear Model option.)<br /> 6) Optimize. Click the Solve button in the dialog box in Figure 3.5. At this point, Solver does its work. It searches through a number of possible solutions until it finds the optimal solution. (You can watch the progress on the lower left of the screen, although for small models the process is virtually instantaneous.) When it finishes, it displays the message shown in Figure 3.7. You can then instruct it to return the values in the decision variable cells to their original (probably nonoptimal) values or retain the optimal values found by Solver. In most cases you should choose the latter. For now, click the OK button to keep the Solver solution. You should see the solution shown in Figure 3.8.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solver Tip: Messages from Solver<br /> Actually, the message in Figure 3.7 is the one you hope for. However, in some cases Solver is not able to find an optimal solution, in which case one of several other messages appears. We discuss some of these later in the chapter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> This solution says that PC Tech should produce 560 Basics and 1200 XPs. This plan uses all available labor hours for assembling, has a few leftover labor hours for testing, produces as many XPs as can be sold, and produces a few less Basics than could be sold. No plan can provide a net profit larger than this one without violating at least one of he constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The solution in Figure 3.8 is typical of solutions to optimization models in the following sense. Of all the inequality constraints, some are satisfied exactly and others are not. In this solution the XP maximum sales and assembling labor constraints are met exactly. We say that they are binding. However, the Basic maximum sales and testing labor constraints are nonbinding. You can think of the binding constraints as bottlenecks. They are the constraints that prevent the objective from being improved. If it were not for the binding constraints on maximum sales and labor, PC Tech could obtain an even larger net profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
An inequality constraint is binding if the solution makes it an equality. Otherwise, it is nonbinding.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In a typical optimal solution, you should usually pay particular attention to two aspects of the solution. First, you should check which of the decision variable cells are positive (as opposed to 0). Generically, these are the “activities” that are done at a positive level. In a product mix model, they are the products included in the optimal mix. Second, you should check which of the constraints are binding. Again, these represent the bottlenecks that keep the objective from improving.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong><br /> Binding and Nonbinding Constraints<br /> Most optimization models contain constraints expressed as inequalities. In an optimal solution, each such constraint is either binding (holds as an equality) or nonbinding. It is extremely important to identify the binding constraints because they are the constraints that prevent the objective from improving. A typical constraint is on the availability of a resource. If such a constraint is binding, the objective could typically improve by having more of that resource. But if such a resource constraint is nonbinding, more of that resource would not improve the objective at all.</p>

4:This is not entirely true. If the objective line is exactly parallel to one of the constraint lines, there can be multiple optimal solutions—a whole line segment of optimal solutions. Even in this case, however, it is still true that at least one of the optimal solutions is a corner point.</p>
