            <p class="blog"><strong>SELLING CONDOS AT BLACKSTONE DEVELOPMENT</strong></p> <p class="blog">Blackstone Development Company has just finished building 120 high-end condos, each priced at $300,000. Blackstone has hired another company, Pletcher Marketing, to market and sell these condos. Pletcher will incur all of the marketingand maintenance costs,assumed to be $800 per unsold condo per month, and it will receive a 10% commission ($30,000) from Blackstone at the time of each condo sale. Because Blackstone wants these condos to be sold in a timely manner, it has offered Pletcher a $200,000 bonus at the end of the first year if at least half of the condos have been sold, and an extra $500,000 bonus at the end of the second year if all of the condos have been sold. Pletcher estimates that it can sell five condos per month on average, so that it should be able to collect the bonuses. However, Pletcher also realizes that there is uncertainty about the number of sales per month. How should this uncertainty be modeled, and will the resulting simulation model give different qualitative results than a deterministic model where exactly five condos are sold per month?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To develop a simulation model that allows us to see how the uncertain timing affects the monetary outcomes for Pletcher, and to compare this simulation model to a deterministic model with no uncertainty about the timing of sales.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The inputs are straightforward from Blackstone’s agreement with Pletcher. The only difficulty is determining an appropriate probability model for the timing of sales, which we discuss next.</p>

To make a fair comparison between a deterministic model with five sales per month and a simulation model with uncertainty in the timing of sales, we need a discrete distribution for monthly sales that has mean 5. One attractive possibility is to use the Poisson distribution discussed briefly in Chapter 5. It is discrete, and it has only one parameter, the mean. The Poisson distribution has one theoretical drawback in that it allows all nonnegative integers to occur, but this has no practical effect. As shown in Figure 16.34, the Poisson distribution with mean 5 has virtually no probability of values larger than, say, 15.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The variables for the model appear in Figure 16.35. (See the file Selling Condos Big Picture.xlsx.) The deterministic model is straightforward and is not shown here. By selling a sure five condos permonth, Pletcher sells all condos by the end of year 2, receives both bonuses, and realizes an NPV (including bonuses) of $2,824,333. However, this is not very realistic. The steps for creating a more realistic simulation model follow. (See Figure 16.36, with several hidden columns, and the file Selling Condos Finished.xlsx.) Because of the uncertain timing of sales, we cannot say when all 120 condos will be sold. It could be before 24 months or well after 24 months. Therefore, we model it through 40 months. (By experimenting, we found that all 120 condos will almost surely be sold in 40 months.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the given inputs in the blue ranges.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Random demands. Generate the random demands for condos (the number of people who would like to buy) by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16&gt;0,RiskPoisson($B$12),””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B15 and copying across to month 40. The IF function checks whether there are still any condos available in that month. If there aren’t, a blank is recorded. Similar logic appears in many of the other formulas.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Number remaining and sold. In cell B16, enter a link to cell B3. In cell B17, find the number sold as the minimum of supply and demand with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16&gt;0,MIN(B16,B15),””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In cell C16, find the number remaining to be sold with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16&gt;0,B16-B17,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then copy the formulas in cells C16 and B17 across. Note that a 0, not a blank, is recorded in row 16 after all condos have been sold. This makes all the other IF functions work correctly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Monetary values. Enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16&gt;0,$B$4*(B16-B17),””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16&gt;0,$B$5*B17,””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B16&gt;0,SUM(B19:B21)-B18,””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B18, B19, and B22, respectively, and copy these across. For the bonuses, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(SUM(B17:M17)&gt;=B3/2,B6,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(SUM(B17:Y17)=B3,B7,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells M20 and Y21. These capture the all-or-nothing nature of the bonuses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Outputs. Three interesting outputs are the number of months required to sell out, the total bonus earned, and the NPV of the cash flows, including bonuses. Calculate these in cells B24–B26 with the formulas<br /> =COUNTIF(B16:AO16,”&gt;0”)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=M20+Y21</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=NPV(B8,B22:AO22)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then designate them as @RISK output cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Set @RISK to run 1000 iterations for a single simulation. Then run the simulation in the usual way.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Recall that the deterministic model sells out in 24 months, receives both bonuses, and achieves an NPV of about $2.82 million. As you might guess, the simulation model doesn’t do this well. The main problem is that there is a fairly good chance that one or both bonuses will not be received. Distributions of the three outputs appear in Figures 16.37 through 16.39. Figure 16.37 shows that although 24 months is (nearly) the most likely number of months to sell out, there was at least one scenario where it took only 18 months and another where it took 32 months. Figure 16.38 shows the four possibilities for bonuses: receive neither, receive one or the other, or receive both. Unfortunately for Pletcher, the first three possibilities are fairly likely; the probability of receiving both bonuses is only about 0.37. Finally, the shape of the NPV distribution in Figure 16.39, with three separate peaks, is influenced heavily by the bonuses or lack of them. On average, the NPV is only about $2.38 million, much less than estimated by the deterministic model. This is still one more example—a dramatic one—of the flaw of averages.</p>
