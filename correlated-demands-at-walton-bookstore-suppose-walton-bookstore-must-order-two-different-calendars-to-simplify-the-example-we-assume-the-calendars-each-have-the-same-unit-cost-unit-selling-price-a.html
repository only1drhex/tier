            <p class="blog"><strong>CORRELATED DEMANDS AT WALTON BOOKSTORE</strong></p> <p class="blog">Suppose Walton Bookstore must order two different calendars. To simplify the example, we assume the calendars each have the same unit cost, unit selling price, and unit refund value as in previous examples. Also, we assume that each hasa triangularlydistributed demand with parameters 100, 175, and 300. However, we now assume they are “substitute” products, so that their demands are negatively correlated. This means that if a customer buys one, she is not likely to buy the other. Specifically, we assume a correlation of 20.9 between the two demands. How do these correlated inputs affect the distribution of profit, as compared to the situation where the demands are uncorrelated (correlation 0) or highly positively correlated (correlation 0.9)?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To see how @RISK enables us to simulate correlated demands, and to see the effect of correlated demands on profit.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong></p> <p class="blog">The only new input here is the correlation.

The key to building in correlation is @RISK’s RiskCorrmat (correlation matrix) function. To use this function, you must include a correlation matrix in the model, as shown in the range J5:K6 of Figure 15.45. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; Correlated Demands Finished.xlsx.) A correlation matrix must always have 1’s along its diagonal (because a variable is always perfectly correlated with itself) and the correlations between variables elsewhere. Also, the matrix must be symmetric, so that the correlations above the diagonal are a mirror image of those below it. (You can enforce this by entering the formula 5J6 in cell K5. Alternatively, @RISK allows you to enter the correlations only below the diagonal, or only above the diagonal, and it then infers the mirror images.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
To enter random values in any cells that are correlated, you start with a typical @RISK formula, such as</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang(E4,E5,E6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The RiskCorrmat function is “tacked on” as an extra argument to a typical random @RISK function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then you add an extra argument, the RiskCorrmat function, as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskTriang(E4,E5,E6,RiskCorrmat(J5:K6,1))</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first argument of the RiskCorrmat function is the correlation matrix range. The second is an index of the variable. In this example, the first calendar demand has index 1 and the second has index 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Function</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
RiskCorrmat</p>
 <p class="blog">
This function enables you to correlate two or more input variables. The function has the form RiskCorrmat( CorrMat,Index), where CorrMat is a matrix of correlations and Index is an index of the variable being correlated to others. For example, if there are three correlated variables, Index is 1 for the first variable, 2 is for the second, and 3 is for the third. The RiskCorrmat function is not entered by itself. Rather, it is entered as the last argument of a random @RISK function, such as =RiskTriang(10,15,30,RiskCorrmat(CorrMat,2)).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Armed with this knowledge, the simulation model in Figure 15.45 is straightforward and can be developed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the blue ranges in columns B and E.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Correlation matrix. For the correlation matrix in the range J5:H6, enter 1’s on the diagonal, and enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=J6</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell K5 (or leave cell K5 blank). Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskSimtable(I9:K9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell J6. This allows you to simultaneously simulate negatively correlated demands, uncorrelated demands, and positively correlated demands.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Order quantities. Assume for now that the company orders the same number of each calendar, 200, so enter this value in cells B9 and B10. However, the simulation is set up so that you can experiment with any order quantities in these cells, including unequal values.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Correlated demands. Generate correlated demands by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(RiskTriang(E4,E5,E6,RiskCorrmat(J5:K6,1)),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B14 for demand 1 and the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ROUND(RiskTriang(E4,E5,E6,RiskCorrmat(J5:K6,2)),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B15 for demand 2. The only difference between these is the index of the variable being generated. The first has index 1; the second has index 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Other formulas. The other formulas in rows 14 and 15 are identical to ones developed in previous examples, so they aren’t presented again here. The quantities in row 16 are sums of rows 14 and 15. Also, the only @RISK output we designated is the total profit in cell F16, but you can designate others as output cells if you like.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
You should set up and run @RISK exactly as before. For this example, set the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of simulations to 3 (because three different correlations are being tested).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Selected numerical and graphical results are shown in Figures 15.46 and 15.47. You will probably be surprised to see that the mean total profit is the same, regardless of the correlation. This is no coincidence. In each of the three simulations, @RISK uses the same random numbers but “shuffles” them in different orders to get the correct correlations. This means that averages are unaffected. (The idea is that the average of the numbers 30, 26, and 48 is the same as the average of the numbers 48, 30, and 26.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, the correlation has a definite effect on the distribution of total profit. You can see this in Figure 15.46, for example, where the standard deviation of total profit increases as the correlation goes from negative to zero to positive. This same increase in variability is apparent in the histograms in Figure 15.47. Do you see intuitively why this increase in variability occurs? It is basically the “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket” effect. When the correlation is negative, high demands for<br /> one product tend to cancel low demands for the other product, so extremes in profit are rare. However, when the correlation is positive, high demands for the two products tend to go together, as do low demands. These make extreme profits on either end much more likely.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This same phenomenon would occur if you simulated an investment portfolio containing two stocks. When the stocks are positively correlated, the portfolio is much riskier (more variability) than when they are negatively correlated. Of course, this is the reason for diversifying a portfolio.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We illustrated the RiskCorrmat function for triangularly distributed values. However, it can be used with any of @RISK’s distributions by tacking on RiskCorrmat as a last argument. You can even mix them. For example, assuming CMat is the range name for a 2 × 2 correlation matrix, you could enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskNormal (10,2,RiskCorrmat (CMat,))</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskUniform(100,200,RiskCorrmat (CMat,2))</p>
 <p class="blog">
With the RiskCorrmat function, you can correlate random numbers from any distributions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
into any two cells. When you run the simulation, @RISK generates a sequence of normally distributed random numbers based on the first formula and another sequence of uniformly distributed random numbers based on the second formula. Then it shuffles them in some complex way until their correlation is approximately equal to the specified correlation in the correlation matrix.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Correlated Inputs</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you enter random inputs in an @RISK simulation model and then run the simulation, each iteration generates independent values for the random inputs. If you know or suspect that some of the inputs are positively or negatively correlated, you should build this correlation structure into the model explicitly with the RiskCorrmat function. This function might not change the mean of an output, but it can definitely affect the variability and shape of the output distribution.</p>
