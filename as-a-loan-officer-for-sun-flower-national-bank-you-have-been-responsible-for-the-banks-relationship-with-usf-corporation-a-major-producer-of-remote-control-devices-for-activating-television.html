The bank’s credit analysts estimated the customer probably will keep an average deposit balance of $2,125,000 for the year the line is active. What is the expected net rate of return from this proposed loan renewal if the customer actually draws down the full amount of the requested line for nine months? What decision should the bank make under the foregoing assumptions? If you decide to turn down this request, under what assumptions regarding revenues, expenses, and customer deposit balances would you be willing to make this loan?</p>

The expected revenues and costs from continuing the present relationship between Sun Flower National Bank and USF Corporation were given in this problem and the reader is asked to estimate the expected net rate of return if the bank renews its loan to USF.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total of expected revenues and expected costs is:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="514"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="249">Expected Revenues</td> <td colspan="2" width="265">Expected Costs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest Revenue</td> <td>$400,000</td> <td>Deposit Interest</td> <td>$ 74,375</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Commitment Fees</td> <td>100,000</td> <td>Cost of Other Funds Raised</td> <td>180,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Deposit Service</td> <td>4,500</td> <td>Wire Transfer Costs</td> <td>1,300</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(Maintenance) Fees</td> <td></td> <td>Loan Processing Costs</td> <td>12,400</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Wire Transfer Fees</td> <td>3,500</td> <td>Record keeping Expenses</td> <td>4,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Agency Fees</td> <td>4,500</td> <td>Account Activity Cost</td> <td>5,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Expected Revenues</td> <td>$512,500</td> <td>Total Expected Costs</td> <td>$ 277,575</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Given: Total Expected Revenues = $512,500</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Expected Costs = $277,575</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Net Revenue = $512,500 &#8211; $277,575 = $234,925</p>
 <p class="blog">
Net Funds Loaned = $10,000,000 &#8211; $2,125,000 = $7,875,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Expected Net Rate of Return = $$234,925/ $7,875,000 = .0298 or 2.98%</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the estimated net rate of return is positive, the bank should strongly consider approving the loan as requested because the bank can earn a premium over its costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you decide to turn down this request, under what assumptions regarding revenues, expenses, and customer-maintained deposit balances would you make this loan?</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
An initial reaction might be to increase loan revenues by raising the interest rate on the loan or increasing the loan commitment fee. Depending on the customer&#8217;s relationship with the bank and with other banks, this may prove to be extremely difficult. Initially, it was assumed that the customer would draw down the entire line of credit, that is, borrow the full $10,000,000. If the customer were to borrow less than the full amount, the cost of funds raised to support this loan could be reduced, increasing the net revenue from the loan. Relative to expenses, it would be more likely that some adjustment in the expenses associated with the relationship would be more appropriate. For example, a careful</p>

 <p class="blog">
examination of the relationship activities could allow for a revision of estimated costs incurred by the bank to manage the various aspects of the relationship. As far as the customer-maintained balances are concerned, there could be an opportunity to revise these estimates upward, making the net funds loaned smaller and the expected net rate of return greater.</p>
