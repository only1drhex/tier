Financial institutions are starting to offer several insurance products. One product that they offer today is life insurance in which the bank promises to pay a beneficiary a specific cash payment in the event of the death of the policyholder. Another insurance product they are interested in is acting as a life insurance underwriter. Here, the institution would manage risks associated with paying life insurance claims. They want to profit from managing insurable risks and collect more in life insurance premiums than they pay in claims. Financial institutions are also getting involved in selling insurance policies for protection from loss due to personal injury, property damage and other losses associated with property and casualty insurance products. In addition, they want to underwrite property-casualty insurance risks. Again, they want to collect more in premiums than they have to pay in claims on these contracts.</p>

There are two potential advantages to offering these services. One of these is the product line diversification effect which means that because these products are not highly correlated with their other services that it can reduce the variability of the overall cash flows generated from the institution. In addition, there may be potential economies of scope from offering these products. Potential cost savings may exist because the same personnel can offer both traditional services as well as the newer nontraditional services such as insurance products. On the other hand, selling insurance services requires financial institutions to adhere to strict consumer protection rules.</p>
