            <p class="blog">Air to be supplied to a hospital operating room is first purified by forcing it through a single-stage compressor. As it travels through the compressor, the air temperature initially increases due to compression, then decreases as it is returned to atmospheric pressure. Harmful pathogen particles in the air will also be heated and subsequently cooled, and they will be destroyed if their maximum temperature exceeds a lethal temperature <span class="tex-text">\( T_{d} \)</span>. Consider spherical pathogen particles (D = 10 μm, ρ = 900 kg/m³ , c = 1100 J/kg .K, and k = 0.2 W/m.K) that are dispersed in unpurified air. During the process, the air temperature may be described by an expression of the form <span class="tex-text">\(T_{∞}(t) = 125 °C - 100 °C . cos(2πt/t_{p})\)</span>, where tp is the process time associated with flow through the compressor. If <span class="tex-text">\(t_{p} \)</span>= 0.004 s, and the initial and lethal pathogen temperatures are <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}\)</span> = 25 °C and <span class="tex-text">\(T_{d}\)</span> = 220°C, respectively, will the pathogens be destroyed? The value of the convection heat transfer coefficient associated with the pathogen particles is h = 4600 W/m² .K.</p>

The solution to this first-order differential equation may be obtained analytically, or by numerical integration.</p>

Analytical Solution Equation 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous differential equation, therefore the solution can be found as the sum of a homogeneous and a particular solution, <span class="tex-text">\(T = T_{h} +T_{p}\)</span>. The homogeneous part, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{h}\)</span>, corresponds to the homogeneous differential equation, <span class="tex-text">\(dT_{h} /dt = -(6h/\rho cD)T_{h}\)</span>, which has the familiar solution, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{h} = c_{0} exp(-6ht/\rho cD)\)</span>. The particular solution, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{p}\)</span>, can then be found using the method of undetermined coeffi-cients; for a nonhomogeneous term that includes a cosine function and a constant term, the particular solution is assumed to be of the form <span class="tex-text">\(T_{p} = c_{1} cos(2πt/t_{p}) + c_{2} sin(2πt/t_{p}) + c_{3}\)</span>. Substituting this expression into Equation 1 yields values for the coefficients, resulting in</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{p}= 125°C &#8211; 100°C \times A \left[\cos \left(\frac{2\pi t}{t_{p}} \right) + \frac{2 \pi \rho c D}{6 h t_{p}} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{t_{p}} \right) \right] \)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A = \frac{(6 h /\rho c D)^{2}}{(6 h /\rho c D)^{2} + (2 \pi /t_{p})^{2}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
The initial condition, <span class="tex-text">\(T(0) = T_{i}\)</span> , is then applied to the complete solution, <span class="tex-text">\(T = T_{h} +T_{p}\)</span>, to yield <span class="tex-text">\(c_{0} = 100 °C(A &#8211; 1)\)</span>. Thus, the particle temperature is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{t}= 125°C + 100°C \left\{(A-1)\exp \left(-\frac{6 h t}{\rho c D} \right) -A\left[\cos \left(\frac{2 \pi t}{t_{p}} \right) +\frac{2 \pi \rho c D}{6 h t_{p}}\sin \left(\frac{2 \pi t}{t_{p}} \right) \right] \right\} \)</span> (3)</p>

To find the maximum pathogen temperature, we could differentiate Equation 3 and set the result equal to zero. This yields a lengthy, implicit equation for the critical time <span class="tex-text">\(t_{crit}\)</span> at which the maximum temperature is reached. The maximum temperature may then be found by substituting <span class="tex-text">\(t = t_{crit}\)</span> into Equation 3. Alternatively, Equation 3 can be plotted or T(t) may be tabulated to find</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(T_{max} = 212 °C &lt; 220 °C\)</span> <p class="blog">
Hence, the pathogen is not destroyed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comments:<br /> 1. The analytical and numerical solutions agree, as they must.<br /> 2. As evident in the previous plot, the air and pathogen particles initially have the same temperature, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{i}\)</span> = 25 °C. The pathogen thermal response lags that of the air since a tem-perature difference must exist between the air and the particle in order for the pathogen to be heated or cooled. As required by Equation 1 and as evident in the plot, the maxi-mum particle temperature is reached when there is no temperature difference between the air and the pathogen.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. The maximum pathogen temperature may be increased by extending the duration of the process. For a process time of <span class="tex-text">\(t_{p} \)</span>= 0.008 s, the air and pathogen particle temperatures are as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The maximum particle temperature is now <span class="tex-text">\(T_{max} = 221 °C &gt; T_{d} = 220 °C\)</span>, and the pathogen would be killed. However, because the duration of the cycle is twice as long as originally specified, approximately half of the air could be supplied to the operating room compared to the <span class="tex-text">\(t_{p}\)</span> = 0.004 s case. A trade-off exists between the amount of air that can be delivered to the operating room and its purity.<br /> 4. The maximum possible radiation heat transfer coefficient may be calculated based on the extreme temperatures of the problem and by assuming a particle emissivity of unity. Hence,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r,max} = \sigma (T_{max} +T_{min})(T^{2}_{max} +T^{2}_{min}) =5.67 \times 10^{-8} W/m^{2} . K^{4}\times (498 + 298)K ×(498^{2}+298^{2})K^{2} = 15.2 W/m^{2} . K\)</span> <p class="blog">
Since <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r,max} ≪ h\)</span>, radiation heat transfer is negligible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. The Der(T, t) function of the IHT software was used to generate the numerical solution for this problem. See Comment 3 of . If one is familiar with a numerical solver such as IHT, it is often much faster to obtain a numerical solution than an analyti-cal solution, as is the case in this example. Moreover, if one seeks maximum or mini-mum values of the dependent variable or variables, such as the pathogen temperature in this example, it is often faster to determine the maxima or minima by inspection, rather than with an analytical solution. However, analytical solutions often explicitly show parameter dependencies and can provide insights that numerical solutions might obscure.<br /> 6. A time increment of Δt = 0.00001 s was used to generate the numerical solutions. Generally, the accuracy of a numerical integration improves with decreasing Δt, but at the expense of increased computation time. For this example, results for Δt = 0.000005 s are virtually identical to those obtained for the larger time increment, indicating that either increment is sufficient to accurately depict the temperature his-tory and to determine the maximum particle temperature.<br /> 7. Assumption of instantaneous pathogen death at the lethal temperature is an approximation. Pathogen destruction also depends on the duration of exposure to the high temperatures [2].</p>
