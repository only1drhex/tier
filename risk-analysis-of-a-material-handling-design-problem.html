A food processing company is designing a new distribution center, which will be built to its specifications and leased back to it over a 10-year period. Full pallet loads of products are received from the production plant, and full pallet loads are shipped to various destination points. Each pallet load of products weighs approximately 1800 pounds. Three alternatives are being considered: block stacking pallet loads on the floor and storing/retrieving using conventional fork lift trucks; storing the pallets in conventional pallet racks and storing/ retrieving using narrow-aisle lift trucks; and storing/retrieving pallet loads using an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS). If block stacking is used, a conventional warehouse design is acceptable, since pallet loads will not be stacked more then four loads high; if narrow-aisle lift trucks are used with selective pallet rack, then loads will be stored to a height of <span class="tex-text">\(30^{\prime}\)</span>; and if an automated storage and retrieval machine is used, storage can occur up to a height of <span class="tex-text">\(75^{\prime}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Conventional lift trucks cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 20,000\)</span> each; narrow-aisle lift trucks cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 30,000\)</span> each; automated storage and retrieval machines cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 350,000\)</span> each. Selective pallet rack costs <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 50\)</span> per pallet position; 15 -tier height AS/RS rack costs <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 175\)</span> per pallet position. Conventional <span class="tex-text">\(21^{\prime}-\)</span> tall storage space can be leased at an annual cost of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 11\)</span> per square foot; <span class="tex-text">\(35^{\prime}\)</span> storage space can be leased at an annual cost of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 15\)</span> per square foot; <span class="tex-text">\(80^{\prime}\)</span> tall storage space can be leased at an annual cost of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 30\)</span> per square foot. Currently, operators for conventional lift trucks cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 20,000\)</span> per year; operators for narrow-aisle lift trucks cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 25,000\)</span> per year. AS/RS computers and controls cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 500,000\)</span>, plus <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 25,000\)</span> per <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{S} / \mathrm{R}\)</span> machine.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The number of lift trucks, narrow-aisle trucks, and <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{S} / \mathrm{R}\)</span> machines depends on the throughput (number of storages and retrievals to be performed per day); the size of the warehouse depends on the number of pallet loads stored. The daily supply of 2000 pallet loads from the production plant is fairly constant, due to the need to keep the production lines operating during the day. However, the shipping rate varies, depending on the season of the year and changing customer demand. For that reason, it has been decided that the distribution center will have the capacity to store five days&#8217; supply (10,000 pallet loads) of products.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Including the footprint for the pallet, aisle requirements, and honeycomb losses arising from block stacking, the firm estimates the floor space requirements for each &#8220;block stack&#8221; of products equal <span class="tex-text">\(40 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span>. With four-high stacking, there are <span class="tex-text">\(10,000 / 4\)</span>, or 2,500 stacks. Hence, <span class="tex-text">\(100,000 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span> of storage space is required for block stacking. Similarly, with narrowaisle and eight-tier storage, each pallet position requires, on average, <span class="tex-text">\(5.625 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span> of floor space, for a total of <span class="tex-text">\(56,250 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span> of warehouse space required for narrow-aisle storage. Finally, with 15 -tier storage in the AS/RS and an aisle that is <span class="tex-text">\(5^{\prime}\)</span> wide, the firm estimates the average square footage requirement per pallet, including end-of-aisle accumulation and maintenance space, to total <span class="tex-text">\(2 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span> per pallet; therefore, <span class="tex-text">\(20,000 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span> of warehouse space is required for automatically storing and retrieving products.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There will be other space in the distribution center for offices, equipment maintenance, restrooms, order accumulation, receiving, shipping, and other activities. However, this space does not depend on the method of storage of the pallet loads received and shipped. Also, there will be maintenance people required for the storage and retrieval equipment, but the firm estimates the number and cost will be approximately the same, regardless of which alternative is chosen. Finally, with each alternative method of storage and retrieval, pallet loads of products will be delivered to deposit stations, from which pallet conveyors will deliver the loads to accumulation lanes for shipping. Hence, the only significant design differences relate to the method of storage of the product.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The distribution center operates two eight-hour shifts per day. The firm estimates each lift truck operator can store or retrieve 15 pallet loads per hour when the product is block stacked. When the product is stored in narrow aisles, it is estimated that each narrowaisle operator can store or retrieve 20 pallet loads per hour; each <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{S} / \mathrm{R}\)</span> machine can store or retrieve 30 pallet loads per hour. Hence, on a daily basis, a total of <span class="tex-text">\(\lceil 4000 /[15(16)]\)</span>, or 17 conventional lift trucks and 34 lift truck operators, are required; <span class="tex-text">\(\lceil 4000 /[20(16)]\)</span>, or 13 narrow-aisle trucks and 25 narrow aisle truck operators, are required; and <span class="tex-text">\([4000 /[30(16)]\)</span>, or <span class="tex-text">\(9 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{R}\)</span> machines, are required.</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, daily demand will not be uniform throughout the 16-hour operating period; neither will daily demand be constant. Therefore, to accommodate variations in demand and to have backup capacity in the event of equipment failure, the company plans to have 20 conventional lift trucks and 40 lift truck operators, or 15 narrow-aisle trucks and 30 narrow-aisle truck operators, or <span class="tex-text">\(10 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{R}\)</span> machines.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If <span class="tex-text">\(10 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{R}\)</span> machines are required to meet the throughput requirements, then the storage rack does not need to be 15 tiers in height. For example, if the aisle is &#8220;only&#8221; 55′ tall and capable of 12 tiers of storage, then the rack cost per pallet position for an AS/RS rack reduces to <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 98\)</span> per pallet position, and the leasing cost for space reduces to <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 18\)</span> per <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{ft}^{2} .\)</span> With 10 aisles, each 12 tiers in height, an aisle length of <span class="tex-text">\(\lceil 10,000 /[2(10)(12)]\)</span>, or 42 pallet widths, is adequate to meet the requirements. The storage space for 10 aisles, 42 pallet widths in length, including input/output requirements, is estimated to be approximately <span class="tex-text">\(29,500 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For each alternative, total labor cost is a normally distributed random variable with a mean that increases at a combined annual rate of <span class="tex-text">\(4 \%\)</span> and a standard deviation that equals <span class="tex-text">\(20 \%\)</span> of the mean value. Annual maintenance cost for conventional lift trucks is also a normally distributed random variable, with a mean of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 2,000\)</span> per truck the first year, increasing at a combined rate of <span class="tex-text">\(6 \%\)</span> per year; its standard deviation is expected to equal <span class="tex-text">\(25 \%\)</span> of the mean. The annual maintenance cost for narrow-aisle trucks is a normally distributed random variable, with a mean of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 2,500\)</span> and a standard deviation of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 500\)</span>; the mean is expected to increase at a combined rate of <span class="tex-text">\(10 \%\)</span> per year, but the standard deviation is expected to remain constant over time. Annual maintenance cost for <span class="tex-text">\(S / R\)</span> machines is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 4,000\)</span> and a standard deviation of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 1,000 ;\)</span> the mean increases at a combined rate of <span class="tex-text">\(5 \%\)</span> per year, and the standard deviation increases by <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 250\)</span> per year in then-current dollars.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Building utility and maintenance costs are considered to be a normally distributed random variable with a mean of <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 1.75\)</span> per square foot. The mean is expected to increase at a combined annual rate of <span class="tex-text">\(5 \%\)</span>; standard deviation is expected to equal <span class="tex-text">\(15 \%\)</span> of the mean.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Leased space is contracted to increase at an annual rate of <span class="tex-text">\(1 \%\)</span> above the inflation rate. Payments for leased space are due at the beginning of the year. Except for lease payments, amounts stated above for annual recurring costs are in end-of-year-one dollars. Storage/retrieval equipment and storage rack acquisition costs are expressed in end-of-year-zero dollars.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The computers, controls, industrial trucks, and <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{S}\)</span> / <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{R}\)</span> machines qualify as 3-year property; the storage rack qualifies as 7 -year property. The income tax rate is <span class="tex-text">\(40 \%\)</span>. The real after-tax minimum attractive rate of return is <span class="tex-text">\(10 \%\)</span>. Annual inflation is anticipated to be <span class="tex-text">\(3 \%\)</span> per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Which storage method minimizes the present worth cost over a 10 year planning horizon? What is the probability of each alternative having a nonnegative present worth?</p>
 <p class="blog">
The underlying spreadsheet for the simulation of the block stacking storage alternative using counterbalanced lift trucks is shown in Figure 11.21.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the @RISK software to simulate 100,000 investments produced, the simulation results are given in Figure <span class="tex-text">\(11.22 .\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
On average, using a narrow-aisle lift truck to store and retrieve pallet loads that are stored in selective pallet racks is the least costly alternative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Based on 100,000 simulated investments, the average after-tax present worth is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 9,570,268.39\)</span> for the conventional lift truck alternative with block stacking (BS). The average after-tax present worth of the narrow-aisle lift truck (NAT) alternative is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 9,298,533.05 .\)</span> The average after-tax present worth for the automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 13,275,453.28\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the net present values were relatively close for the BS and NAT alternatives, we also computed the net present value for the incremental investment (BS &#8211; NAT); as shown, the average present worth for the difference in using conventional lift trucks versus narrow-aisle trucks is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 271,735.34\)</span>. The sample standard deviation for the present worth of the incremental investment is <span class="tex-text">\(\$ 77,951.62\)</span>. Based on the central limit theorem, the probability of the incremental present worth being less than zero is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}\operatorname{Pr}[\mathrm{PW}(\mathrm{BS}-\mathrm{NAT})&lt;0] &amp;=\mathrm{NORMSDIST}(-271735.34 / 77951.62) \\&amp;=0.00245198\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
or approximately 245 times in 100,000 simulated investments.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In 100,000 simulated investments, 30 times the block stacking alternative had a smaller present worth cost than the narrow-aisle alternative. The AS/RS was never the preferred alternative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A nice feature of @RISK being <span class="tex-text">\(\text { Excel }^{\circledR}\)</span>-based is the ease of performing sensitivity analysis. For example, one can determine how much the cost parameters have to change in order for the AS/RS alternative to have the greatest net present value.</p>
