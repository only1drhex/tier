            <p class="blog">You are designing an apparatus to support an actor of mass 65 kg who is to “fly” down to the stage during the performance of a play. You attach the actor’s harness to a 130-kg sandbag by means of a lightweight steel cable running smoothly over two frictionless pulleys, as in Figure 8.8a. You need 3.0 m of cable between the harness and the nearest pulley so that the pulley can be hidden behind a curtain.<br /> For the apparatus to work successfully, the sandbag must never lift above the floor as the actor swings from above the stage to the floor. Let us call the initial angle that the actor’s cable makes with the vertical θ. What is the maximum value θ can have before the sandbag lifts off the floor?</p>

We must use several concepts to solve this problem.<br /> To conceptualize, imagine what happens as the actor approaches the bottom of the swing. At the bottom, the cable is vertical and must support his weight as well as provide centripetal acceleration of his body in the upward direction. At this point, the tension in the cable is the highest and the sandbag is most likely to lift off the floor.<br /> Looking first at the swinging of the actor from the initial point to the lowest point, we categorize this as an energy problem involving an isolated system—the actor and the Earth. We use the principle of conservation of mechanical energy for the system to find the actor’s speed as he arrives at the floor as a function of the initial angle θ and the radius R of the circular path through which he swings.<br /> Applying conservation of mechanical energy to the actor–Earth system gives</p>

<span class="tex-text">\( K_{f}+U_{f}=K_{i}+U_{i} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(1) <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{1}{2} m_{\text {actor }} v_{f}^{2}+0=0+m_{\text {actor }} g y_{i} \)</span>.</p>

<span class="tex-text">\( \text { where } y_{i} \text { is the initial height of the actor above the floor and } \)</span><span class="tex-text">\( v_{f} \text { is the speed of the actor at the instant before he lands. } \)</span><span class="tex-text">\( \text { (Note that } K_{i}=0 \text { because he starts from rest and that } \)</span><span class="tex-text">\( U_{f}=0 \)</span> because we define the configuration of the actor at the floor as having a gravitational potential energy of zero.)<br /> From the geometry in Figure 8.8a, and noting that <span class="tex-text">\( y_{f}=0, \)</span> we see that <span class="tex-text">\( y_{i}=R-R \cos \theta=R(1-\cos \theta) \)</span>. Using this relationship in Equation (1), we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
(2) <span class="tex-text">\( v_{f}^{2}=2 g R(1-\cos \theta) \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, we focus on the instant the actor is at the lowest point. Because the tension in the cable is transferred as a force applied to the sandbag, we categorize the situation at this instant as a Newton’s second law problem. We apply Newton’s second law to the actor at the bottom of his path, using the free-body diagram in Figure 8.8b as a guide:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \sum F_{y}=T-m_{\text {actor }} g=m_{\text {actor }} \frac{v_{f}^{2}}{R} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(3) <span class="tex-text">\( T=m_{\text {actor }} g+m_{\text {actor }} \frac{v_{f}^{2}}{R} \)</span>,</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, we note that the sandbag lifts off the floor when the upward force exerted on it by the cable exceeds the gravitational force acting on it; the normal force is zero when this happens. Thus, when we focus our attention on the sandbag, we categorize this part of the situation as another Newton’s second law problem. A force T of the magnitude given by Equation (3) is transmitted by the cable to the sandbag. If the sandbag is to be just lifted off the floor, the normal force on it becomes zero and we require that <span class="tex-text">\( T=m_{\text {bag }} g \)</span> as in Figure 8.8c. Using this condition together with Equations (2) and (3), we find that</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( m_{\text {bag }} g=m_{\text {actor }} g+m_{\text {actor }} \frac{2 g R(1-\cos \theta)}{R} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving for <span class="tex-text">\( \cos \theta \)</span> and substituting in the given parameters, we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \cos \theta=\frac{3 m_{\text {actor }}-m_{\text {bag }}}{2 m_{\text {actor }}}=\frac{3(65 kg )-130 kg }{2(65 kg )}=0.50 \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \theta=60^{\circ} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that we had to combine techniques from different areas of our study—energy and Newton’s second law. Furthermore, we see that the length R of the cable from the actor’s harness to the leftmost pulley did not appear in the final algebraic equation. Thus, the final answer is independent of R.</p>
