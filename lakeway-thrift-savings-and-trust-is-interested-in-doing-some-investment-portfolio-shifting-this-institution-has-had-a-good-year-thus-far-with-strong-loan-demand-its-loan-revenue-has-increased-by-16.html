a. Selling $4 million in 12-year City of Dallas bonds with a coupon rate of 7.5 percent and purchasing $4 million in bonds from Bexar County (also with 12-year maturities) with a coupon rate of 8% and issued at par. The Dallas bonds have a current market value of $3,750,000 but are listed at par on the thrift institution’s books</p>
 <p class="blog">
b. Selling $4 million in 12-year U.S. Treasury bonds that carry a coupon rate of 12% and are recorded at par, which was the price when the bank purchased them. The market value of these bonds has risen to $4,330,000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Which of these two portfolio shifts would you recommend? Is there a good reason for not selling the Treasury bonds? What other information is needed to make the best decision? Please explain.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Under Option A Lakeway will take an immediate $4 million &#8211; $3.75 million, or $250,000, loss before taxes (or a loss of $162,500 after taxes) which can be used to help offset the high taxable loan income earned this year. Moreover, the thrift will be able to earn 8% on an investment of $4 million, or $320,000, in annual interest income compared to only $300,000 with the bonds currently held or a gain in taxexempt income of $20,000 per year. (Of course, if the thrift can only afford to buy $3,750,000 in new municipals &#8211; the sale price of the old bonds &#8211; it will generate about $300,000 in after-tax interest and have no net gain in tax-exempt interest income, but will still have a tax-deductible loss on the sale of the old bonds.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Under Option B the U.S. Treasury bonds must be sold for a gain of $330,000 which is taxable income. Because Lakeway does not need additional taxable income, Option B is less desirable than Option A. Besides, the Treasury bonds are selling at a premium above par which indicates their coupon rate is higher than current interest rates on investments of comparable risk, suggesting the wisdom of retaining these bonds in the bank&#8217;s portfolio either until loan revenues decline and the bank needs additional taxable income or until interest rates rise well above current levels and new securities appear that promise significantly higher interest yields.</p>
