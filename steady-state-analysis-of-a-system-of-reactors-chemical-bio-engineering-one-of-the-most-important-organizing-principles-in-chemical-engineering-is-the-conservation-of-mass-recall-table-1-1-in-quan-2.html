The mass balance can be used for engineering problem solving by expressing the inputs and outputs in terms of measurable variables and parameters. For example, if we were performing a mass balance for a conservative substance (that is, one that does not increase or decrease due to chemical transformations) in a reactor (Fig. 12.2), we would have to quantify the rate at which mass flows into the reactor through the two inflow pipes and out of the reactor through the outflow pipe. This can be done by taking the product of the flow rate Q (in cubic meters per minute) and the concentration c (in milligrams per cubic meter) for each pipe. For example, for pipe 1 in Fig. 12.2, <span class="tex-text">\(Q_1 = 2 m^3/min\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(c_1 = 25 mg/m^3\)</span>; therefore, the rate at which mass flows into the reactor through pipe 1 is <span class="tex-text">\( Q_{1} c_{1}=\left(2 m ^{3} / min \right)\left(25 mg / m ^{3}\right)=50 mg / min\)</span> . Thus, 50 mg of chemical flows into the reactor through this pipe each minute. Similarly, for pipe 2 the mass inflow rate can be calculated as <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} c_{2}=\left(1.5 m ^{3} / min \right)\left(10 mg / m ^{3}\right)=15 mg / min\)</span>. Notice that the concentration out of the reactor through pipe 3 is not specified by Fig. 12.2. This is because we already have sufficient information to calculate it on the basis of the conservation of mass. Because the reactor is at steady state, Eq. (12.2) holds and the inputs should be in balance with the outputs, as in</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1} c_{1}+Q_{2} c_{2}=Q_{3} c_{3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Substituting the given values into this equation yields</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(50+15=3.5 c_{3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
which can be solved for <span class="tex-text">\(c_{3}=18.6 mg / m ^{3}\)</span>. Thus, we have determined the concentration in the third pipe. However, the computation yields an additional bonus. Because the reactor is well mixed (as represented by the propeller in Fig. 12.2), the concentration<br /> will be uniform, or homogeneous, throughout the tank. Therefore the concentration in pipe 3 should be identical to the concentration throughout the reactor. Consequently, the mass balance has allowed us to compute both the concentration in the reactor and in the outflow pipe. Such information is of great utility to chemical and petroleum engineers who must design reactors to yield mixtures of a specified concentration.</p>
 <p class="blog">
in Fig. 12.2, it might not be obvious how computers figure in mass-balance calculations. Figure 12.3 shows a problem setting where computers are not only useful but are a practical necessity. Because there are five interconnected, or coupled, reactors, five simultaneous mass-balance equations are needed to characterize the system. For reactor 1, the rate of mass flow in is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(5(10)+Q_{31} c_{3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
and the rate of mass flow out is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{12} c_{1}+Q_{15} c_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Because the system is at steady state, the inflows and outflows must be equal:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(5(10)+Q_{31} c_{3}=Q_{12} c_{1}+Q_{15} c_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
or, substituting the values for flow from Fig. 12.3,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(6 c_{1}-c_{3}=50\)</span> <p class="blog">
Similar equations can be developed for the other reactors:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(-3 c_{1}+3 c_{2}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(-c_{2}+9 c_{3}=160\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(-c_{2}-8 c_{3}+11 c_{4}-2 c_{5}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(-3 c_{1}-c_{2}+4 c_{5}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
A numerical method can be used to solve these fi ve equations for the fi ve unknown concentrations:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\{C\}^{T}=\left\lfloor\begin{array}{lllll}11.51 &amp; 11.51 &amp; 19.06 &amp; 17.00 &amp; 11.51\end{array}\right.\)</span> <p class="blog">
In addition, the matrix inverse can be computed as</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\([A]^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}0.16981 &amp; 0.00629 &amp; 0.01887 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0.16981 &amp; 0.33962 &amp; 0.01887 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0.01887 &amp; 0.03774 &amp; 0.11321 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0.06003 &amp; 0.07461 &amp; 0.08748 &amp;0.09091 &amp; 0.04545 \\0.16981 &amp; 0.08962 &amp; 0.01887 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.25000\end{array}\right]\)</span> <p class="blog">
Each of the elements <span class="tex-text">\(a_{ij}\)</span> signifies the change in concentration of reactor i due to a unit change in loading to reactor j. Thus, the zeros in column 4 indicate that a loading to reactor 4 will have no impact on reactors 1, 2, 3, and 5. This is consistent with the system configuration (Fig. 12.3), which indicates that flow out of reactor 4 does not feed back into any of the other reactors. In contrast, loadings to any of the first three reactors will affect the entire system as indicated by the lack of zeros in the first three columns. Such information is of great utility to engineers who design and manage such systems.</p>
