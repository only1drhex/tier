A naive approach to this problem is to compare the average female salary to the average male salary. This can be done with a pivot table, as in Chapter 3, or with a more formal hypothesis test, as in Chapter 9. Using these methods, you can check that the average of all salaries is $39,922, the female average is $37,210, the male average is $45,505, and the difference between the male and female averages is statistically significant at any reasonable level of significance. In short, the females definitely earn less. But perhaps there is a reason for this. They might have lower education levels, they might have been hired more recently, and so on. The question is whether the difference between female and male salaries is still evident after taking these other attributes into account. This is a perfect task for regression.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first task is to create dummy variables for the various categorical variables. You can do this manually with IF functions. (You can also use the StatTools Dummy procedure.) To do it manually, create a dummy variable Female based on Gender in any blank column by entering the formula =IF(F2=“Female”,1,0) and copying it down. Note that females are coded as 1’s and males as 0’s. (Remember that the quotes are necessary when a text value is used in an IF function.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is also possible to add dummies to effectively collapse categories.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sometimes you might want to collapse several categories. For example, you might want to collapse the five education categories into three categories: 1, (2,3), and (4,5). The new second category includes employees who have taken undergraduate courses or have completed a bachelor’s degree, and the new third category includes employees who have taken graduate courses or have completed a graduate degree. It is easy to do this. You can again use IF functions, or you can simply add the Educ2 and Educ3 columns to get the dummy for the new second category. Similarly, you add the Educ4 and Educ5 columns for the new third category. (Do you see why this works?)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once the dummies have been created, you can run a regression analysis with Salary as the dependent variable, using any combination of numeric and dummy explanatory variables. Indeed, this is the procedure that must be used with most statistical software packages: create dummy variables and then run regressions that include the dummies. However, Stat-Tools now lets you avoid the first step of creating explicit dummies in new columns. It lets you run regressions with implicit dummies. This keeps the original data set intact (no need for a lot of extra columns), and it is much quicker and less tedious.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First, however, there are two general rules you should always follow, regardless of the statistical software being used:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. You shouldn’t use any of the original categorical variables, such as Education, that the dummies are based on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. You should always use one fewer dummy than the number of categories for any categorical variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Always include one fewer dummy than the number of categories. The omitted dummy corresponds to the reference category.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This second rule is a technical one. If you violate it, the statistical software (StatTools or other packages) will display an error message. For example, if you want to use education level as an explanatory variable, you should enter only four of the five dummies Educ1 through Educ5. Any four of these can be used. The omitted dummy then corresponds to the reference category. The interpretation of any dummy variable coefficient is relative to this reference category. When there are only two categories, as with the gender variable, the common procedure is to name the variable with the category, such as Female, that corresponds to the 1’s. If you create the dummy variables manually, you probably will not even bother to create a dummy for males. In this case “Male” automatically becomes the reference category.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To explain dummy variables in regression, it is useful to proceed in several steps in this example. (After you get used to the procedure, you can combine all of these steps into a single step. Alternatively, you can use a stepwise procedure, as explained in the next chapter.) Each step will have a dummy for Female and one or more additional explanatory variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first regression will include a dummy for Female and the experience variables, Years1 and Years2. If you want to run this regression with StatTools, you should fill out the StatTools Regression\ dialog box as shown in Figure 10.28. Note that each variable has a Data Type: Numeric or Category. StatTools chooses this type automatically, based on whether the column is totally numeric. If you check a Category variable such as Gender, StatTools implicitly creates a dummy variable for all but one of its categories and then uses these in the regression. (StatTools chooses the reference category as the last one in alphabetical order, in this case, Male.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resulting output appears in Figure 10.29. As usual, the Coefficient column lists the coefficients of the regression equation. To help with interpretation, StatTools provides the option of listing the regression equations for the various categories. (Refer to the Display Regression Equation option in Figure 10.18.) Specifically, the Female and Male equations appear in rows 26 and 27. They are identical except that the intercept of the Male equation is about $8080 larger than the intercept of the Female equation, and this difference is precisely the coefficient of the Gender dummy in row 22.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can interpret the coefficient 28080 of the Female dummy variable as the average salary disadvantage for females relative to males after controlling for job experience. Therefore, gender discrimination still appears to be a very plausible conclusion. However, note that the <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> value is only 49.2%. Perhaps there is still more to the story.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The next step is to add education level to the equation by including four of the five education level dummies. If you want to do this with StatTools, you should fill out the StatTools Regression dialog box as shown in Figure 10.30. Note that the Data Type for Education is originally Numeric, but it is more appropriate to change this to Category, as shown. After all, the values for Education are codes, not really numbers. Then when you check Education, dummies for the first four education levels are created implicitly and included in the regression equation. (The reference category, education level 5, is again the last in alphabetical order.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resulting output, with the equations again spelled out at the bottom, appears in Figure 10.31. There is an equation for each combination of Gender and Education categories, or 10 equations in all. As before, only the intercepts differ. In particular, you can check that the difference between the Female and Male intercepts, for any specific education level, is always the Gender coefficient in row 26. This means that after controlling for experience and education, there is a $4501 “penalty” for being a female.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The coefficients of the Education dummies in rows 20–23 are all relative to the reference category, education level 5. Because these coefficients are all negative, they indicate how much less the average salary for that education level is, relative to level 5, after controlling for experience and gender. For example, a person with education level 4 tends to be paid about $4450 less than a similar person with education level 5.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the <span class="tex-text">\(R^{2}\)</span> value is now 64.5%, quite a bit larger than when the education dummies were not included. We appear to be getting closer to the truth. In particular, you can see that there appears to be gender discrimination in salaries, even after accounting for job experience and education level.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One further explanation for gender differences in salary might be job grade. Perhaps females tend to be in lower job grades, which would help explain why they get lower salaries on average. One way to check this is with a pivot table, as in Figure 10.32, with job grade in the Rows area, gender in the Columns area, and counts, displayed as percentages of columns in the Values area. Clearly, females tend to be concentrated at the lower job grades. For example, 28.85% of all employees are at the lowest job grade, but 34.29% of all females are at this grade and only 17.65% of males are at this grade. The opposite is true at the higher job grades. This certainly helps to explain why females get lower salaries on average.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is possible to go one step further to see the effect of job grade on salary. As with the education dummies, dummies for job grade could be entered in the regression. The regression output, not shown here, is available in the Regression 3 sheet of the finished version of the file. It indicates that there is still a penalty for being a female, but this penalty has been reduced to about $2563 due to controlling for job grade.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The regression indicates that being in lower job grades implies lower salaries, but it doesn’t explain why females are in the lower job grades in the first place.</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, using job grade to “explain” gender discrimination is not really appropriate. The real question is why females are predominantly in the low job grades in the first place. Perhaps this is the real source of gender discrimination. Perhaps management is not advancing the females as quickly as it should, which naturally results in lower salaries for females. In a sense, job grade is not really an explanatory variable; it is a dependent variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We conclude this example for now, but we will say more about it in the next two subsections.</p>
