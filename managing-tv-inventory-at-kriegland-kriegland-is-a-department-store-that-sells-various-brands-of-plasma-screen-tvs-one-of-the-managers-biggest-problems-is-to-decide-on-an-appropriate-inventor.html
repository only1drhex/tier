            <p class="blog"><strong>MANAGING TV INVENTORY AT KRIEGLAND </strong></p> <p class="blog">Kriegland is a department store that sells various brands of plasma screen TVs. One of the manager’s biggest problems is to decide on an appropriate inventory policy for stocking TVs. He wants to have enough in stock so that customers receive their requests right away, but he does not want to tie up too much money in inventory that sits on the storeroom floor.</p> <p class="blog">Most of the difficulty results from the unpredictability of customer demand. If this demand were constant and known, the manager could decide on an appropriate inventory policy fairly easily. But the demand varies widely from month to month in a random manner. All the manager knows is that the historical average demand per month is approximately 17. Therefore, he decides to call in a consultant. The consultant immediately suggests using a probability model. Specifically, she attempts to find the probability distribution of demand in a typical month. How might she proceed?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To model the probability distribution of monthly demand for plasma screen TVs with a particular Poisson distribution.</p>

Let X be the demand in a typical month. The consultant knows that there are many possible values of X. For example, if historical records show that monthly demands have always been between 0 and 40, the consultant knows that almost all of the probability should be assigned to the values 0 through 40. However, she does not relish the thought of finding 41 probabilities, <span class="tex-text">\(P(X=0) \text { through } P(X=40)\)</span>, that sum to 1 and reflect historical frequencies. Instead, she discovers from the manager that the histogram of demands from previous months is shaped much like the graph in Figure 5.21. That is, it rises to some peak and then falls.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Knowing that a Poisson distribution has this same basic shape, the consultant decides to model the monthly demand with a Poisson distribution. To choose a particular Poisson distribution, all she has to do is choose a value of λ, the mean demand per month. Because the historical average is approximately 17, she chooses <span class="tex-text">\(\lambda=17\)</span>. Now she can test the Poisson model by calculating probabilities of various events and asking the manager whether these probabilities are reasonable approximations to reality.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For example, the Poisson probability that monthly demand is less than or equal to 20, <span class="tex-text">\(P(X \leq 20)\)</span>, is 0.805 [using the Excel function POISSON.DIST120,17,TRUE2], and the probability that demand is between 10 and 15 inclusive, <span class="tex-text">\(P(10 \leq X \leq 15)\)</span>, is 0.345 [using POISSON.DIST115,17,TRUE2- POISSON.DIST19,17,TRUE2]. Figure 5.22 illustrates various probability calculations and shows the graph of the individual Poisson probabilities. (See the file Poisson Demand Distribution Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the manager believes that these probabilities and other similar probabilities are reasonable, then the statistical part of the consultant’s job is finished. Otherwise, she must try a different Poisson distribution—a different value of λ—or perhaps a different type of distribution altogether.</p>
