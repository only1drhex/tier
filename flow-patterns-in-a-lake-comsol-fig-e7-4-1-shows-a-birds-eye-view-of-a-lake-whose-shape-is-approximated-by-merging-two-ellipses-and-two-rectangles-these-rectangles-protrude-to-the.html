            <p class="blog"><strong>Flow Patterns in a Lake (COMSOL)</strong></p> <p class="blog">Fig. E7.4.1 shows a bird&#8217;s-eye view of a lake whose shape is approximated by merging two ellipses and two rectangles. These rectangles protrude to the &#8220;west&#8221; at <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{AB}\)</span> and to the &#8220;south&#8221; at <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{CD}\)</span>, and can serve as an inlet and an outlet to and from the lake, respectively.</p> <p class="blog">Note that the inviscid flow (possibly with rotation) is governed by Poisson&#8217;s equation:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span class="tex-text">\(-\nabla^{2} \psi=-\left(\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial y^{2}}\right)=f,\)</span> (E7.4.1)</p> <p class="blog">in which <span class="tex-text">\(\psi\)</span> is the stream function. In COMSOL, Eqn. (E7.4.1) is represented as <span class="tex-text">\(\nabla \cdot(-c \nabla u)=f\)</span>, where <span class="tex-text">\(u=\psi\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(c=1\)</span> in our case.</p> <p class="blog">For two-dimensional flow, it can readily be shown that <span class="tex-text">\(-\nabla^{2} \psi=\zeta\)</span>, where <span class="tex-text">\(\zeta=\left(\partial v_{y} / \partial x-\partial v_{x} / \partial y\right)\)</span> is the vorticity, so that <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> acts as a source term for the vorticity. If <span class="tex-text">\(f=0\)</span>, the vorticity will be zero and there will be no rotation. But a positive value of <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> would mean that the vorticity is positive, corresponding to a counterclockwise rotation. And a negative value of <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> would indicate a clockwise rotation. Such rotations could result from the shear stresses induced on the surface of the lake by a nonuniform wind, whose velocity <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}\)</span> varies with <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> as shown in Fig. E7.4.2. Note that in the eastern region <span class="tex-text">\((x&gt;0)\)</span> the intensity increases toward the east, and in the western region <span class="tex-text">\((x&lt;0)\)</span> the intensity increases toward the west.</p> <p class="blog">Solve for the pattern of streamlines for each of the following three cases, using SI units throughout:</p> <ol> <li>The stream function equals <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=0\)</span> along the near shore between points B and C and equals <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=100\)</span> along the far shore between points D and A. From B to A and from C to D, <span class="tex-text">\(\psi\)</span> varies linearly from zero to 100 . Everywhere, <span class="tex-text">\(f=0\)</span>.</li> <li>The rivers are &#8220;turned off,&#8221; so the lake is now isolated and its boundary becomes the single streamline <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=0\)</span>. However, the vorticity source term is now <span class="tex-text">\(f=2.5 \times 10^{-6} x \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\)</span>. Thus, we would expect a counterclockwise rotation for <span class="tex-text">\(x&gt;0\)</span> and a clockwise rotation for <span class="tex-text">\(x&lt;0\)</span>.</li> <li>Finally, consider the case of both river flow and the nonuniform wind. The boundary conditions will be the same as for Case 1, but the expression for <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> will be the same as for Case 2 .</li> </ol> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/7-4-1-768x493.jpg"></div><div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/7-4-2-768x402.jpg"></div>

<strong>Discussion of Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Case 1. The streamlines are shown in Fig. E7.4.3. The COMSOL results do not show the direction of flow, but it can easily be ascertained as follows. Observe over most of the lake that <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x}=\partial \psi / \partial y\)</span> is positive and that <span class="tex-text">\(v_{y}=-\partial \psi / \partial x\)</span> is negative. Clearly, the flow enters at <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{AB}\)</span> and leaves at <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{CD}\)</span>, and arrows to that effect have been added.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The direction of flow could easily be reversed, by assigning <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=100\)</span> to the near shore BC and <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=0\)</span> to the far shore DA. Note that a Dirichlet boundary condition was used for the inlet, with the stream function varying linearly from zero at <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{B}\)</span> to 100 at <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{A}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Case 2. The streamlines are shown in Fig. E7.4.4. The lake is now completely closed, with no river flow, so the entire shoreline is the single streamline <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=0\)</span>. However, there is now a nonuniform wind blowing, corresponding to Fig. E7.4.2, resulting in counter-rotating circulatory patterns in the two halves of the lake. Arrows have been added to indicate the direction of motion. Recall that the interpolated value of the dependent variable <span class="tex-text">\(u(=\psi)\)</span> can be obtained by clicking on any point in the lake. With this feature in mind, the COMSOL results show that the stream function is approximately <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=-68.9 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> at the &#8220;eye&#8221; of the left-hand half and <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=73.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> at the eye of the right-hand half.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Case 3. The streamlines are shown in Fig. E7.4.5. The river has been switched &#8220;on&#8221; again, and the nonuniform wind still blows. The results are essentially a combination of Cases 1 and 2. The river still enters at AB and leaves at CD, but has to follow a somewhat more tortuous path as it wends its way between the two circulating patterns, which are now diminished in size as a result. The stream function is approximately <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=-27.5 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> at the left-hand eye and <span class="tex-text">\(\psi=165.9\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> at the right-hand eye.</p>
