We first estimate and interpret an exponential trend for the first 10 years. Then we see how well the projection of this trend into the future fits the data in the most recent five years. The time series graph for the first 10 years appears in Figure 12.19. You can use Excel’s Trendline tool, with the Exponential option, to superimpose an exponential trend line and the corresponding equation on this plot. The fit is evidently quite good. Equivalently, Figure 12.20 illustrates the time series of log sales for this same period, with a linear trend line superimposed. Its fit is equally good.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can also use regression to estimate this exponential trend, as shown in Figure 12.21. (We again use Excel functions to perform the regression.) To produce this output, you must first add a time variable in column C (with values 1 through 40) and create a logarithmic transformation of Sales in column D. Then you can regress Log(Sales) on Time (using the data for the first 10 years only) to obtain the regression output. Note that its two coefficients in cells L2 and L3 are the same as those shown for the linear trend in Figure 12.20. If you take the antilog of the constant 4.130 (with the formula 5EXP(L2)), you will obtain the constant multiple shown in Figure 12.19. It corresponds to the constant c in Equation (12.7).</p>
 <p class="blog">
What does it all mean? The estimated Equation (12.7) is</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Y_{t}=c e^{b t} u_{t}\)</span> (12.7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\text { Forecast Sales }=62.188 e^{0.0654 t}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The most important constant in this equation is the coefficient of Time, 0.0654. Expressed as a percentage, this coefficient implies that the company’s sales increased by approximately 6.54% per quarter throughout this 10-year period. (The constant multiple, 62.188, is the forecast of sales at time 0; that is, quarter 4 of 2001.) To calculate the forecasts in column E, we first used the regression equation to forecast the log of sales and then used the EXP to find the antilog. Specifically, the formula in cell E2 is = EXP($L$2 + $L$3*C2), which can then be copied down. (It is important to realize that without the EXP function, you would be calculating forecasts of log sales, which are of little interest.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Has this exponential growth continued in the most recent five years? It has not, due possibly to slumping sales in the computer industry or increased competition from other manufacturers. This is apparent from the time series graph of the two series Sales and Forecast, for all years, shown in Figure 12.22. It is clear that sales in the later years did not exhibit nearly the 6.54% growth observed in the early years. As the company should realize, nothing this good lasts forever.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before leaving this example, we comment briefly that any of the three forecast error measures discussed previously are easy to find, as shown in Figure 12.21. (You can check the formulas in the finished version of the file.) For example, forecasts for the 10-year estimation period were off, on average, by 8.30%, but as you can check, forecasts for the quarters after 2011 were off by much more.</p>
