The method is spelled out in Figure 8.3 by the formulas shown in column D. The calculations follow directly from Equation (8.4). As in Figure 8.2, the T.INV.2T function is used to find the correct multiple. Its arguments are one minus the confidence level and the degrees of freedom. The result is that the 95% confidence interval extends from 5.739 to 6.761.</p>

Because the Excel calculations for a confidence interval are always the same (for a mean or for other population parameters), we have created a template file, Confidence Interval Template.xlsx, you can use. It has a sheet for each of the population parameters discussed in this chapter. For example, the sheet CI Mean shown in Figure 8.4 explains how to use the template for a population mean. The best way to proceed is to copy the appropriate template sheet to your data file and then follow the directions in the text box. If you do this for the sandwich rating data, you get the results in Figure 8.3, where we have shaded the only cells you need to change in orange and the confidence interval in yellow. The template sheets not only provide a quick way to get the correct results, but they also provide formulas you can examine to see how the confidence intervals are calculated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In any case, the principal results are that (1) the best guess for the population mean rating is 6.250, and (2) a 95% confidence interval for the population mean rating extends from 5.739 to 6.761. The manager can be 95% confident that the true mean rating over all customers who might try the sandwich is within this confidence interval.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We stated previously that as the confidence level increases, the length of the confidence interval increases. You can convince yourself of this by entering different confidence levels such as 90% or 99%. The lower and upper limits of the confidence interval will change automatically, getting closer together for the 90% level and farther apart for the 99% level. Just remember that you, the analyst, can choose the confidence level, but 95% is the level most commonly chosen.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before leaving this example, we discuss the assumptions that lead to the confidence interval. First, you might question whether the sample is really a random sample—or whether it matters. Perhaps the manager used some random mechanism to select the customers to be surveyed. More likely, however, she simply surveyed 40 consecutive customers who tried the sandwich on a given day. This is called a convenience sample and is not really a random sample. However, unless there is some reason to believe that these 40 customers differ in some relevant aspect from the entire population of customers, it is probably safe to treat them as a random sample.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A second assumption is that the population distribution is normal. We made this assumption when we introduced the t distribution. Obviously, the population distribution cannot be exactly normal because it is concentrated on the 10 possible satisfaction ratings, and the normal distribution describes a continuum. However, this is probably not a problem for two reasons. First, confidence intervals based on the t distribution are robust to violations of normality. This means that the resulting confidence intervals are approximately valid for any populations that are approximately normal. Second, the normal population assumption is less crucial for larger sample sizes because of the central limit theorem. A sample size of 40 should be large enough.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, it is important to recognize what this confidence interval implies and what it doesn’t imply. In the entire population of customers who ordered this sandwich, there is a distribution of satisfaction ratings. Some fraction rate it as 1, some rate it as 2, and so on. All we are trying to determine here is the average of all these ratings. Based on the analysis, the manager can be 95% confident that this (still unknown) average is between 5.739 and 6.761. However, this confidence interval doesn’t tell her other characteristics of the population of ratings that might be of interest, such as the proportion of customers who rate the sandwich 6 or higher. It only provides information about the mean rating. Later in this chapter, you will see how to find a confidence interval for a proportion, which allows you to analyze another important characteristic of a population distribution.</p>
