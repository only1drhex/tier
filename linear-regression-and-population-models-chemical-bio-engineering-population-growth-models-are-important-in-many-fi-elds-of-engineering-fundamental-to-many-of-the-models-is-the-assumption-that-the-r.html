First, it must be recognized that the specifi c growth rate k cannot be constant as the population becomes large. This is the case because, as p approaches infi nity, the organism being modeled will become limited by factors such as food shortages and toxic waste production. One way to express this mathematically is to use a saturation-growth-rate model such that</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(k=k_{\max } \frac{f}{K+f}\)</span> (20.3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(k_{max}\)</span> = the maximum attainable growth rate for large values of food ( f ) and K = the half-saturation constant. The plot of Eq. (20.3) in Fig. 20.1 shows that when <span class="tex-text">\(f = K, k = k_{max}/2 \)</span>. Therefore, K is that amount of available food that supports a population growth rate equal to one-half the maximum rate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The constants K and <span class="tex-text">\(k_{max} \)</span> are empirical values based on experimental measurements of k for various values of f. As an example, suppose the population p represents a yeast employed in the commercial production of beer and f is the concentration of the carbon source to be fermented. Measurements of k versus f for the yeast are shown in Table 20.1.</p>

It is required to calculate <span class="tex-text">\(k_{max}\)</span> and K from these empirical data. This is accomplished by inverting Eq. (20.3) in a manner similar to Eq. (17.17) to yield</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{y}=\frac{\beta_3 }{\alpha _3}\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{\alpha _3}\)</span> (17.17)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{k}=\frac{K+f}{k_{\max } f}=\frac{K}{k_{\max }} \frac{1}{f}+\frac{1}{k_{\max }}\)</span> (20.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
By this manipulation, we have transformed Eq. (20.3) into a linear form, that is, 1/k is a linear function of 1/f, with slope <span class="tex-text">\(K/k_{max}\)</span> and intercept <span class="tex-text">\(1/k_{max}\)</span>. These values are plotted in Fig. 20.2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because of this transformation, the linear least-squares procedures described in Chap. 17 can be used to determine <span class="tex-text">\(k_{\max }=1.23 day ^{-1}\)</span> and K = 22.18 mg/L. These results<br /> combined with Eq. (20.3) are compared to the untransformed data in Fig. 20.3, and when substituted into the model in Eq. (20.1), give</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d p}{d t}=1.23 \frac{f}{22.18+f} p\)</span> (20.5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the fi t yields a sum of the squares of the residuals (as computed for these untransformed data) of 0.001305.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equation (20.5) can be solved using the theory of differential equations or using numerical methods discussed in Chap. 25 when f(t) is known. If f approaches zero as p becomes large, then dp/dt approaches zero and the population stabilizes.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The linearization of Eq. (20.3) is one way to evaluate the constants <span class="tex-text">\(k_{max}\)</span> and K. An alternative approach, which fi ts the relationship in its original form, is the nonlinear regression described in Sec. 17.5. Figure 20.4 shows how the Excel Solver tool can be used to estimate the parameters with nonlinear regression. As can be seen, a column of predicted values is developed based on the model and the parameter guesses. These are used to generate a column of squared residuals that are summed, and the result is placed in cell D14. The Excel Solver is then invoked to minimize cell D14 by adjusting cells B1:B2. The result, as shown in Fig. 20.4, yields estimates of <span class="tex-text">\(k_{max} = 1.23\)</span> and K = 22.14, with an <span class="tex-text">\(S_r = 0.001302\)</span>. Thus, although, as expected, the nonlinear regression yields a slightly better fit, the results are almost identical. In other applications, this may not be true (or the function may not be compatible with linearization) and nonlinear regression could represent the only feasible option for obtaining a least-squares fi t.</p>
