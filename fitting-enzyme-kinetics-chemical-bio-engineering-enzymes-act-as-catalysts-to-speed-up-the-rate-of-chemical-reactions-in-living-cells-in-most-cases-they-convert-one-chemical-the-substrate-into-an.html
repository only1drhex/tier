            <p class="blog">FITTING ENZYME KINETICS (CHEMICAL/BIO ENGINEERING)</p> <p class="blog">Enzymes act as catalysts to speed up the rate of chemical reactions in living cells. In most cases, they convert one chemical, the substrate, into another, the product. The Michaelis-Menten equation is commonly used to describe such reactions:</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon =\frac{\nu _{m}[S]}{K_{S}+[S]} \)</span> (20.1)</p> <p class="blog">where <span class="tex-text">\(\nu= \)</span> the initial reaction velocity, υm = the maximum initial reaction velocity, <span class="tex-text">\([S] =\)</span> substrate concentration, and <span class="tex-text">\(k_s =\)</span> a half saturation constant. As in Fig. 20.1, the equation describes a saturating relationship that levels off with increasing <span class="tex-text">\([S]\)</span>. The graph also illustrates that the half-saturation constant corresponds to the substrate concentration at which the velocity is half the maximum.<br /> Although the Michaelis-Menten model provides a nice starting point, it has been refined and extended to incorporate additional features of enzyme kinetics. One simple extension involves so-called allosteric enzymes, where the binding of a substrate molecule at one site leads to enhanced binding of subsequent molecules at other sites. For cases with two interacting bonding sites, the following second-order version often results in a better fit:</p> <p class="blog"><span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon =\frac{\nu _{m}[S]^{2}}{K_{S}^{2}+[S]^{2}} \)</span> (20.2)</p> <p class="blog">This model also describes a saturating curve but, as depicted in Fig. 20.1, the squared concentrations tend to make the shape more sigmoid, or S-shaped.<br /> Suppose that you are provided with the following data:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="576"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="72">[S]</td> <td width="72">1.3</td> <td width="72">1.8</td> <td width="72">3</td> <td width="72">4.5</td> <td width="72">6</td> <td width="72">8</td> <td width="72">9</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="72"><span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon\)</span></td> <td>0.07</td> <td width="72">0.13</td> <td width="72">0.22</td> <td>0.275</td> <td width="72">0.335</td> <td width="72">0.35</td> <td width="72">0.36</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">Employ linear regression to fit these data with linearized versions of Eqs. (20.1) and (20.2). Aside from estimating the model parameters, assess the validity of the fits with both statistical measures and graphs.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/02/20.1-768x446.png"></div>

Equation (20.1), which is in the format of the saturation-growth-rate model (Eq. 17.14), can be linearized by inverting it to give [recall Eq. (17.17)]</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(y=\alpha _{3}\frac{x}{\beta _{3}+x} \)</span> (17.14)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{y}=\frac{\beta _{3}}{\alpha _{3}}\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{\alpha _{3}} \)</span> (17.17)</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{\upsilon }=\frac{1}{\upsilon _{m}}+\frac{k_{s}}{\upsilon _{m}}\frac{1}{[S]} \)</span> <p class="blog">
If the model is valid, a plot of <span class="tex-text">\(1/\upsilon \)</span> versus <span class="tex-text">\(1/[S]\)</span> should yield a straight line with an intercept of 1∕υm and a slope of <span class="tex-text">\(k_s/\upsilon_m\)</span>. Using your own program or a software package, you should obtain an intercept of 0.1902 and a slope of 16.4022 with <span class="tex-text">\(r^{2}=0.9344.\)</span> The model coefficients can then be calculated as <span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon _{m}= 1∕0.1902 = 5.2570\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(k_{s}= 5.2570 \times 16.4022 = 86.2260\)</span>, and the best-fit model is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon =\frac{5.2570[S]}{86.2260 + [S]} \)</span> <p class="blog">
Although the high value of <span class="tex-text">\(r^2\)</span> might lead you to believe that this result is acceptable, inspection of the coefficients might raise doubts. For example, the maximum velocity (5.2570) is much greater than the highest observed velocity (0.36). In addition, the halfsaturation rate (86.2260) is much bigger than the maximum substrate concentration (9).<br /> The problem is underscored when the fit is plotted along with the data. Figure 20.2a shows the transformed version. Although the straight line follows the upward trend, the data clearly appear to be curved. When the original equation is plotted along with the data in the untransformed version (Fig. 20.2b), the fit is obviously unacceptable. The data are clearly leveling off at about 0.36 or 0.37. If this is correct, an eyeball estimate would suggest that <span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon _m\)</span> should be about 0.36, and <span class="tex-text">\(k_s\)</span> should be in the range of 2 to 3. Beyond the visual evidence, the poorness of the fit is also reflected by statistics like the coefficient of determination. For the untransformed case, a much less acceptable result of <span class="tex-text">\(r^2= 0.6406\)</span> is obtained.<br /> The foregoing analysis can be repeated for the second-order model. Equation (20.2) can also be linearized by inverting it to give</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{\upsilon }=\frac{1}{\upsilon _{m}}+\frac{k^{2}_s}{\upsilon _{m}}\frac{1}{[S]^{2}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
If the model is valid, a plot of <span class="tex-text">\(1/\upsilon\)</span> versus <span class="tex-text">\(1/[S]^2\)</span> should yield a straight line with an intercept of 1∕υm and a slope of <span class="tex-text">\(k_s^2/\upsilon_m\)</span>. Using your own program or a software package, you should obtain an intercept of 2.4492 and a slope of 19.3760 with <span class="tex-text">\(r^2= 0.9929\)</span>. The model coefficients can then be calculated as <span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon_m = 1/2.4492 = 0.4083\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(k_s =\sqrt{0.4083(19.3760)} = 2.8127\)</span>, and the best-fit model is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\upsilon =\frac{0.4083[S]^2}{7.911 + [S]^2} \)</span> <p class="blog">
Although we know that a high <span class="tex-text">\(r^2\)</span> does not guarantee a good fit, the fact that it is very high (0.9929) is promising. In addition, the parameter values also seem consistent with the trends in the data; that is, the υm is slightly greater than the highest observed velocity and the half-saturation constant is lower than the maximum substrate concentration (9).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The adequacy of the fit can be assessed graphically. As seen in Fig. 20.3a, the transformed results appear linear. When the original equation is plotted along with the data in the untransformed version (Fig. 20.3b), the fit nicely follows the trend in the measurements. Beyond the graphs, the goodness of the fit is also reflected by the fact that the coefficient of determination for the untransformed case can be computed as <span class="tex-text">\(r^2= 0.9896\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the second-order model provides a good fit of this data set. This might suggest that we are dealing with an allosteric enzyme.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Beyond this specific result, there are a few other general conclusions that can be drawn from this case study. First, we should never solely rely on statistics such as <span class="tex-text">\(r^2\)</span> as the sole basis of assessing goodness of fit. Second, regression equations should always be assessed graphically. And for cases where transformations are employed, a graph of the untransformed model and data should always be inspected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, although transformations may yield a decent fit of the transformed data, this does not always translate into an acceptable fit in the original format. The reason that this might occur is that minimizing squared residuals of transformed data is not the same as doing so for untransformed data. Linear regression assumes that the scatter of points around the best fit line follows a Gaussian distribution, and that the standard deviation is the same at every value of the dependent variable. These assumptions are rarely true after transforming data.<br /> As a consequence of the last conclusion, some analysts suggest that rather than using linear transformations, nonlinear regression should be employed to fit curvilinear data.<br /> In this approach, a best-fit curve is developed that directly minimizes the untransformed residuals. This option will be explored in the first problem at the end of this chapter.</p>
