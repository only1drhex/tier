Let n = 1000 be the total number of votes that have been tabulated. If X is the number of Republican votes so far, we are given that X = 540. Now we pose the following question. If the Democrat were going to be the eventual winner, that is, <span class="tex-text">\(N_{ R }&gt;N_{ D }\)</span>, and we randomly sampled 1000 voters from the population, how likely is it that at least 540 of these voters would be in favor of the Republican? If this is very unlikely, then the only reasonable conclusion is that the Democrat will not be the eventual winner. This is the reasoning the networks might use to declare the Republican the winner so early in the tabulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We use a binomial model to see how unlikely the event “at least 540 out of 1000 ” is, assuming that the Democrat will be the eventual winner. We need a value for p, the probability that a typical vote is for the Republican. This probability should be the proportion of voters in the entire population who favor the Republican. All we know is that this probability is less than 0.5, because we have assumed that the Democrat will eventually win. In Figure 5.20, we show how the probability of at least 540 out of 1000 varies with values of p less than, but close to, 0.5. (See the file Election Returns Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
We enter a trial value of 0.49 for p in cell B3 and then calculate the required probability in cell B9 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
= 1-BINOM.DIST(B6-1,B5,B3,TRUE)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then we use this to create the data table at the bottom of the spreadsheet. This data table tabulates the probability of the given lead (at least 540 out of 1000) for various values of p less than 0.5. As shown in the last few rows, even if the eventual outcome were going to be a virtual tie—with the Democrat slightly ahead—there would still be very little chance of the Republican being at least 80 votes ahead so far. But because the Republican is currently ahead by 80 votes, the networks feel safe in declaring the Republican the winner. Admittedly, the probability model they use is more complex than our simple binomial model, but the idea is the same.</p>
