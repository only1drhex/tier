One way to check whether the multiplicative learning model is reasonable is to create the log variables Log(Time) and Log(Batch) in the usual way (with Excel’s LN function) and then see whether a scatterplot of Log(Time) versus Log(Batch) is approximately linear. The multiplicative model implies that it should be. Such a scatterplot appears in Figure 10.44, along with a superimposed linear trend line and the corresponding equation. The fit appears to be quite good.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are two ways to interpret this equation. First, because it is a constant elasticity relationship, the coefficient -0.155 can be interpreted as an elasticity. That is, when Batch increases by 1%, Time tends to decrease by approximately 0.155%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although this interpretation is correct, it is not as useful as the “doubling” interpretation discussed previously. Equation (10.15) states that the estimated learning rate satisfies</p>
 <p class="blog">
b = LN(learning rate)/LN(2) (10.15)</p>
 <p class="blog">
-0.155 = LN(learning rate)/LN(2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving for the learning rate [multiply through by LN(2) and then take antilogs], you can see that it is 0.898, or approximately 90%. In words, whenever cumulative production doubles, the time to produce a batch decreases by about 10%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Presario could use this regression equation to predict future production times. For example, suppose the customer places an order for 15 more batches of the same product. Note that Presario is already partway up the learning curve, that is, these batches are numbers 23 through 37, and the company already has experience producing the product. You can use the equation shown in Figure 10.44 to predict the log of production time for each batch. Then you can take their antilogs and sum them to obtain the total production time. The calculations are shown in rows 24 through 39 of Figure 10.45. You enter the batch numbers and calculate their logs in columns A and C. Then you substitute the values of Log(Batch) in column C into the regression equation to obtain the predicted values of Log(Time) in column E. Finally, you use Excel’s EXP function to calculate the antilogs of these predictions in column B, and you calculate their sum in cell B39. The total predicted time to finish the order is about 1115 hours.</p>
