The only randomness in this problem concerns the time until failure of a new camera. Yakkon could estimate the distribution of time until failure from historical data. This would probably indicate a right-skewed distribution, as shown in Figure 16.5. If you look through the list of distributions available in @RISK under Define Distributions, you will see several with this same basic shape. The one shown in Figure 16.5 is a commonly used distribution called the gamma distribution. We will use a gamma distribution in this example, although other choices such as the triangular are certainly possible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The gamma distribution is a popular distribution when you want a rightskewed distribution of a positive quantity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Selecting a Gamma Distribution</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The gamma distribution is characterized by two parameters, α and β.</p>
 <p class="blog">
These determine its shape and location. It can be shown that the mean and standard deviation are μ =αβ and <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma=\sqrt{\alpha} \beta\)</span>. Alternatively, for any desired values of the mean and standard deviation, these equations can be solved for α and β, which leads to α= μ<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>&gt;σ<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span> and b = s<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>&gt;μ. So, for example, if you want a gamma distribution with mean 2.5 and standard deviation 1 (which in this example would be based on camera lifetime data from the past), you should choose α= 2.5<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>&gt;1<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span> = 6.25 and β =1<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>&gt;2.5 <span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span> 0.4. These are the values shown in Figure 16.5 and the ones used for this example. The values in the figure (from @RISK) imply that the probability of failure before 1.5 years is about 0.15, so that the probability of failure out of warranty is about 0.85.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The variables for the model are shown in Figure 16.6, and the simulation model itself appears in Figure 16.7. (See the files Warranty Costs Big Picture.xlsx and Warranty Costs Finished.xlsx.) The particular random numbers in Figure 16.7 indicate an example (a rather unusual one) where there are two failures within warranty. However, because the lifetime of the second replacement (cell D17) is greater than 1.5, the company incurs only two replacement costs, as shown in cells B19 and C19. The model can be developed with the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Inputs. Enter the inputs in the blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Parameters of gamma distribution. As discussed previously, if you enter a desired mean and standard deviation (in cells B5 and B6), you have to calculate the parameters of the gamma distribution. Do this by entering the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B5^2&gt;B6^2</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B6^2&gt;B5</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B7 and B8</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Lifetimes and times of failures. Generate at most five lifetimes and corresponding times of failures. (Why only five? You could generate more, but it is extremely unlikely that this same customer would experience more than five failures within warranty, so five suffices.) As soon as a lifetime is greater than 1.5, the warranty period, no further lifetimes are required, in which case blanks can be recorded in row 17.</p>
 <p class="blog">
With this in mind, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RiskGamma(B7,B8)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B17*B10,RiskGamma(B7,B8),””)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(C17=””,””,IF(C17*$B$10,RiskGamma($B$7,$B$8),””))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B17, C17, and C17, and copy the latter formula to cells E17 and F17. These formulas guarantee that once a blank is recorded in a cell, all cells to its right will also contain blanks. To get the actual times of failures, relative to time 0 when the customer originally purchases the camera, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B17</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(C17=””,””,B181C17)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B18 and C18, and copy the latter across row 18. These values will be used for the NPV calculation because this requires the exact timing of cash flows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Costs and discounted costs. In row 19, enter the replacement cost of $225 or 0, depending on whether a failure occurs within warranty, and in row 20 discount these costs back to time 0, using the failure times in row 18. To do this, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B17*B10,B12,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(C17=””,0,IF(C17*$B$10,$B$12,0))</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B19 and C19, and copy this latter formula across row 19. Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(B19+0,B19&gt;(11$B$13)^B18,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B20, and copy it across row 20. This formula uses the well known fact that the present value of a cash flow at time t is the cash flow multiplied by 1&gt;(1 + r)<span class="tex-text">\(^t\)</span>, where r is the discount rate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Outputs. Calculate two outputs, the number of failures within warranty and the NPV of profit, with the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=COUNTIF(B17:F17,”*”&amp;$B$10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B112B122SUM(B20:F20)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B22 and B23. Then designate these two cells as @RISK output cells. Note that the NPV is the margin from the sale (undiscounted) minus the sum of the discounted costs from replacements under warranty.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The @RISK setup is typical. Run 1000 iterations of a single simulation (because there is no RiskSimtable function).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The @RISK summary statistics and histograms for the two outputs appear in Figures 16.8 and 16.9. They show a fairly clear picture. About 85% of the time, there are no failures under warranty and the company makes a profit of $175, the margin from the camera sale. However, there is about a 12% chance of exactly one failure under warranty, in which case the company’s NPV of profit will be an approximate $50 loss (before discounting). Additionally, there is about a 3% chance that there will be even more failures under warranty, in which case the loss will be even greater. Note that in our 1000 iterations, the maximum number of failures under warranty was 4, and the maximum net loss was $515.94. On average, the NPV of profit was $139.75.</p>
 <p class="blog">
These results indicate that Yakkon is not suffering terribly from warranty costs. However, there are several ways the company could decrease the effects of warranty costs. First, it could increase the price of the camera. Second, it could decrease the warranty period, say, from 1.5 years to 1 year. Third, it could change the terms of the warranty. For example, it could stipulate that if the camera fails within a year, the customer gets a new camera for free, whereas if the time to failure is between 1 and 1.5 years, the customer pays some pro rata share of the replacement cost. Finally, it could try to sell the customer an extended warranty—at a hefty price. We ask you to explore these possibilities in the problems.</p>

16-2c Drug Production with Uncertain Yield</p>
 <p class="blog">
In many manufacturing settings, products are produced in batches, and the usable yields from these batches are uncertain. This is particularly true in the drug industry. The following example illustrates how a drug manufacturer can take this uncertainty into account when planning production.</p>
