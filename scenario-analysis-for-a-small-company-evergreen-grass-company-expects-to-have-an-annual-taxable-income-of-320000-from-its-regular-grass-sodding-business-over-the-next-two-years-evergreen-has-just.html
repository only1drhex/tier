            <p class="blog"><strong>Scenario Analysis for a Small Company</strong></p> <p class="blog">EverGreen Grass Company expects to have an annual taxable income of $320,000 from its regular grass-sodding business over the next two years. EverGreen has just won a contract to sod grasses for a new golf complex for just those years. This twoyear project requires a purchase of new equipment costing $50,000. The equipment falls into the MACRS five-year class, with depreciation allowances of 20%, 32%, 19.2%, 11.52%, 11.52%, and 5.76% in each of the six years, respectively, during which the equipment will be depreciated. After the contract is terminated, the equipment will be retained for future use (instead of being sold), indicating no salvage cash flow, gain, or loss on this asset. The project will bring in an additional annual revenue of $150,000, but it is expected to incur additional annual operating costs of $90,000. Compute the incremental (marginal) tax rates applicable to the project’s operating profits for years 1 and 2.</p>

<strong>Given:</strong> Base taxable income = $320,000 per year, incremental income, expenses, and depreciation amounts as stated.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Incremental tax rate for this new project in years 1 and 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First, we compute the additional taxable income from the golf course project over the next two years:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="299"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="155"><strong>Year</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong>1</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong>2</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gross Revenue</td> <td>$150,000</td> <td>$150,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Expenses</td> <td>90,000</td> <td>90,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Depreciation</td> <td>10,000</td> <td>16,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taxable income</td> <td>$50,000</td> <td>$44,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Next, we compute the income taxes. To do this, we need to determine the applicable marginal tax rate, but because of the progressive income tax rate on corporations, the project cannot be isolated from the other operations of EverGreen.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We can solve this problem much more efficiently by using the incremental tax rate concept discussed at the beginning of this section. Because the golf course project pushes EverGreen into the 34% tax bracket from the 39% bracket, we want to know what proportion of the incremental taxable income of $50,000 in year 1 is taxed at 39% and what proportion is taxable at 34%. Without the project, the firm’s taxable income is $320,000, and its marginal tax rate is 39%. With the additional taxable income of $50,000, EverGreen’s tax bracket reverts to 34%, as its combined taxable income changes from $320,000 to $370,000. Since the rate changes at $335,000, the first $15,000 of the $50,000 taxable income will still be in the 39% bracket, and the remaining $35,000 will be in the 34% bracket. In year 2, we can divide the additional taxable income of $44,000 in a similar fashion. Then we can calculate the incremental tax rates for the first two years as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(0.39 \left(\frac{\$15,000}{\$50,000} \right) + 0.34 \left(\frac{\$35,000}{\$50,000} \right) = 0.3550\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(0.39 \left(\frac{\$15,000}{\$44,000} \right) + 0.34 \left(\frac{\$29,000}{\$50,000} \right) = 0.3570\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that these incremental tax rates vary slightly from year to year. Much larger changes can occur if a company’s taxable income fluctuates drastically from its continuing base operation.</p>
