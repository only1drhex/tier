The data for this version of the example are in the file Lasagna Triers Naïve Bayes.xlsx. To calculate the probabilities P(X | 0) and P(X |1) described above, the naïve Bayes method requires all explanatory variables to be categorical, with only a few possible values. In this data set, some of the explanatory variables such as Gender and Nbhd are already categorical, but others such as Age and Weight are numeric and essentially continuous. We rearranged the data so that all numeric variables are in contiguous columns (which made for easier copying), and we binned them into four categories, based on their quartiles. For example, the binned Age variable will be 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on which quartile its Age value falls into. A sample of the resulting binned training data set appears in Figure 17.14. Actually, the training data set consists of only 700 of the 856 observations. We use the other 156 observations for testing, and the testing data set is binned similarly. For each set of X values, we need to calculate P(X | 0) and P(X |1). Given the naïve independence assumption, each of these is a product of probabilities, and this product is usually very small. Therefore, it is customary to find the natural logs of the individual probabilities and use the fact that the log of a product is the sum of the logs. Figure 17.15 shows some of the calculations for the 0 category, where Have Tried is No. (See the file Lasagna Triers Naive Bayes Finished.xlsx. Columns AJ–AU tothe right contain similar calculations for the 1 category, where Have Tried is Yes.) For example, the first person’s binned age from Figure 17.14 is 4. Cell W4 then finds the log of the proportion of all people in the 0 category with binned age 4, using COUNTIFS and COUNTIF functions. Fortunately, the formula in cell W4 is copyable to the entire range W4:AG703, and a similar formula in cell AJ4 (replacing “No” with “Yes”) is copyable to the range AJ4:AU703. Then the values in column AH (and column AU) are sums of these logs, meaning that they are the logs of the products of the individual probabilities. More simply, they are the logs of the estimated probabilities P(X | 0) and P(X |1) required for classification.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now we can use these probabilities for classification, either for the training data or the testing data. Some of the results for the training data appear in Figure 17.16. Each prediction in column N is based on a comparison of the total in column AHand the total in column AU, that is, P(X | 0) versus P(X | 1) for that row. (Actually, it is a comparison of their logs, but this is equivalent to a comparison of the probabilities.) If P(X | 0) is larger, we predict No, and if P(X | 1) is larger, we predict Yes. Finally, we check whether the prediction is correct in column O—that is, whether column N matches column M—and we tally the results in columns Q–U.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The calculations for the testing data set, shown in Figure 17.17, are entirely analogous except for one important difference. The log probabilities in columns W:AH and AJ:AU are based on the training data, not on the testing data. Essentially, the training data set is the “model” for this method, so predictions for the testing data (or new data) should be based on this model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In any case, classification accuracy for the training data set in Figure 17.16 is similar to the classification accuracy for the testing data in Figure 17.17, and neither is very different from the logistic regression results in Figure 17.5 or the neural nets results in Figure <span class="tex-text">\( 17.11 .^{3} \)</span> In short, despite its simplicity, the naïve Bayes method is a worthy competitor to these much more complex classification methods.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3 As usual, the results can depend on the training/testing split. You can see how sensitive the results are to this split in the file Lasagna Triers Naïve Bayes Sensitivity.xlsm (which contains a macro you will need to enable).</p>
